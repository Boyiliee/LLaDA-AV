How do I know which vehicle is right for me?
When selecting a rental vehicle, take into consideration where you will be travelling, how many people will be
travelling in the vehicle, luggage size and the kind of driving you intend to do. Auto Europe offers a vast range of
vehicles from small economy sizes to larger full-sized cars, 4WDs, convertibles and luxury vehicles. The ACRISS
system will help you find a car that suits your needs. This is internationally recognised code which will ensure
you get the same standard of vehicle wherever you rent.

Automatic and Manual Transmissions
Both automatic and manual vehicles are available in Netherlands. Automatic vehicles are generally more
expensive than manual cars and may be scarcer at smaller depots.

Do I need a credit card to collect my vehicle?
Yes. A credit card will be needed when collecting, which will be used for a security bond. The deposit is
generally the insurance excess of the rental car which depends on the category of vehicle you have booked
and the rate type.

Collecting at an airport in the Netherlands
At most airports in the Netherlands you will find your rental company has a desk in the arrivals hall, with the
rental cars being located within walking distance. However, at smaller airports you may be required to collect
your vehicle from a downtown depot. A courtesy transfer will be provided from the airport to the depot in this
instance. Auto Europe offer all-inclusive prices which generally include any location / airport fees and charges
that may otherwise apply. Remember to check at time of booking to ensure your rental will include all airport
fees.

Should I hire a GPS for driving in the Netherlands?
GPS hire is available from Auto Europe. Our rates include the GPS unit, travel guides and entertainer. The GPS
is delivered direct to your home or travel agent before you depart. GPS units can also be requested direct with
some suppliers, however this will be at their own rates. If time is short, or you would simply
prefer to collect your GPS unit together with your rental, then this may be an option for you.

Rental Vehicle Insurance

Rental Vehicle Insurance
Dutch law requires all vehicles to have Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance, although your car rental
supplier should already have comprehensive insurance covering their vehicles. In the case of an accident, it
must be reported to the insurance provider immediately and an excess will be due.
Car hire companies in the Netherlands will normally include:


Third Party Insurance and Compulsory Insurance: This will be included in your car hire price. This covers
other people’s injury and any damage to their vehicle.



Collision Damage Waiver (CDW): This limits your financial liability for damage to the rented vehicle and is
normally included in prepaid car hire prices. Rentals are usually subject to liability excess, which can be
reduced at the time you collect your rental car or by taking out Auto Europe Excess Refund Insurance.



Theft and Loss Cover: This limits your financial liability for the loss or theft of the rented vehicle and is
generally included in the prepaid car rental price.



Liability Insurance: This limits your financial liability for bodily injury or death, and is normally included in the
prepaid car hire price.



Personal Accident Insurance: This covers the driver for personal injuries and is generally not included in your
car rental rate. It is considered an optional extra that you can take out upon collection of the car.

Auto Europe Excess Refund Insurance
When renting a vehicle, the rental rates include basic insurance. However, in the event that the vehicle is stolen
or accidentally damaged, there is usually an insurance excess amount which the driver is liable to pay to the
rental company. To avoid any unexpected costs opt for Auto Europe Excess Refund Insurance which will offer a
reimbursement for the supplier’s damage and theft excess to a maximum for AU$5,000. Simply add this onto
your car rental booking prior to departure and you could save thousands of dollars in case of an accident. To
find out more, simply call Auto Europe on 1300 656 601 or visit the Auto Europe website.

The Auto Europe Hire Car Excess Refund Insurance is managed by Accident & Health International Underwriting Pty Limited, ABN 26
053 335 952, AFSL 238261 and underwritten by CGU Insurance Limited, ABN 27 004 478 371, AFSL 238291.

Driving in the Netherlands

Parking
Parking within major cities in the Netherlands is rarely free and parking is limited in major cities. There are
policies in place to deter motorists from bringing their cars into the cities to avoid congestion. Metered parking
areas exist and are known as a “P-Zone”. Parking is not permitted along curbs with black and white or yellow
markings. Some parking areas, known as “Blue Zones”, allow parking only for vehicles with a blue parking disc.
You may purchase these at most tobacconists, police stations and motor club offices.

Licence Requirements
A full driving licence is required to drive in the Netherlands. All drivers must have held a full valid driving licence
for a minimum of one year. Australian residents are not required by law to have an International
Driving Permit (IDP), although it is recommended as an international licence holds more credibility with the
local traffic police than your home driving licence. Contact your local motoring association for further
information.

Min & Max Age Requirements
The minimum driving age in the Netherlands is 21, though drivers under the age of 25 may be required to pay
a young drivers’ surcharge. Most suppliers in the Netherlands do not have a maximum driving age, however
there may be restrictions for drivers aged 70-75 in some regions. In these situations, drivers may be required
to hold a letter from their GP stating they are healthy and fit to drive. Check with Auto Europe Australia for
further details.

Cross Border Fees and One Way Rentals
Can I collect my rental car at a city in Netherlands and drop it off in another European city?
Domestic and international one ways are definitely possible, though they typically incur a one way fee. Prices
may vary depending on the supplier, length of rental and drop off destination.
Can I collect my car in Netherlands, visit another European city, then return it to Netherlands?
Travel to surrounding mainland European countries, as well as the United Kingdom, is certainly possible. Some
suppliers have restrictions on travel to certain Eastern European nations and to Northern European countries
in winter. Please advise your reservations consultant when you make your car hire booking if you are
considering travel outside of the Netherlands.

Driving in the Netherlands

What do I do if I want to extend my rental after I’ve picked up my
vehicle in the Netherlands?

vehicle is available to be extended, you will be offered additional days at the supplier’s local rate.

Self Drive Tours: Western Netherlands

Rotterdam to De Biesbosch
National Park
Start this day trip in Rotterdam, where you can visit the city’s
magnificent museums and monuments. From Rotterdam,
drive south east on the A16 highway to Dordrecht, a historic
city through which you will drive to reach De Biesbosch.
Being one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands, Dordrecht
is definitely worth a visit. While in town, make sure to see De
Grote Kerk, literally meaning “The Big Church”, which is one
of the largest churches in the Netherlands. Continue south east from Dordrecht along the Provincialeweg
Road, which will lead to a dead end when it reaches water. Park and catch the ferry to De Biesbosch, one of
the Netherlands’ most valued natural areas. This is one of the largest national parks in the country and one of
the last few tidal freshwater areas in Europe. Unwind and appreciate the natural beauty you’ll find in De
Biesbosch before heading back to Rotterdam for a fabulous dinner at the top of the Euromast building.

Amsterdam to The Hague
For this daytrip, you can either head directly south west from Amsterdam along the A4 to the A44. If you have
extra time, begin by heading west and travelling via the medieval city of Haarlem. Continuing south west, you’ll
pass through some charming Dutch towns, as well as areas including Kagerplassen, a picturesque network of
lakes surrounded by green fields. Further along, visit Leiden, a small city with a wonderful historic centre and
more relaxed atmosphere than the busy
metropolis of Amsterdam. Leiden is well known
for its museums, especially those which focus
on history, art and antiquities. From Leiden,
take the E19 to the A12, which leads straight to
The Hague. The Hague is an impressive city
featuring an abundance of historic architecture,
fascinating museums, art galleries and the
Dutch Parliament. If you visit during summer, be
sure to check out Scheveningen, the most
famous beach in the Netherlands.

town of Den Bosch (also known as ‘s-Hertogenbosch).
Enjoy the sites of one of the Netherlands’ oldest cities,
where you can see some of the remaining fortifications,

Town Hall and the Moorian. From Den Bosch, head south west on the N65 to the university town of Tilburg,

architecture. Visit the beautiful Church of Our Lady or take in some retail therapy in the city centre.

Islands and the west of North Brabant with
medieval towns, great waterways and luxurious
beach resorts. Begin in the fortified town of Bergen
op Zoom. While here, see the Gevangenpoort,
which are the remains of the town’s former
fortifications. Also worth a visit are Margrave’s
Palace and the beautiful town square. Head south
from Bergen op Zoom on the A58, which will turn west near Woensdrecht and to the town of Middelburg. This is
one of the oldest towns in the Netherlands, boasting historic sites including the Abbey of Our Lady and the
impressive Middelburg Town Hall. Drive back east on the A58 before heading north on the N258 towards the
town of Goes, where you will come across the Oosterschelde. This estuary is the largest National Park in the
Netherlands at 370 square kilometres. You can cross the estuary on the 4km long Zeeland bridge, which
serves as a barrier, dam and road connecting the islands of Schoewen-Duiveland and Noord Beveland. Follow
the N256/N59 north east to the N257until you reach Krammersluizen and the Phillip Dam. From here, drive
south to the town of Tholen, returning to Bergen op Zoom.

Self Drive Tours: Eastern Netherlands

Arnhem to Almere and Oostvaardersplassen
Star this journey in Arnhem, where you can visit The Netherlands
Open Air Museum and stunning Park Sonsbeek, or take a hot air
balloon ride over the countryside. From here, head north west on the
A12/E35 to the city of Utrecht. Stop along the way to explore the
incredible Utrecht Heuvelrug National Park (De Utrechtse
Heuvelrug). From Utrecht, drive north along the A27 which will take
you to the island province of Flevoland. Visit the exciting city of
Almere, the fastest growing city in the Netherlands and home to
fantastic architecture and a remarkable contemporary art museum.
Just a short distance north east of Almere and you will find
Oostvaardersplassen, a huge nature reserve which was created
roughly 40 years ago and is a most worthwhile attraction to get close to local flora and fauna.

Apeldoorn to Amsterdam
This drive will take you between two nearly opposite cities in the Netherlands. Travel from the quiet Apeldoorn,
with its small city centre and dense surrounding forests, to the mighty Amsterdam, which is roughly 10 times
the size. In the outskirts of Apeldoorn you will find the Het Loo Palace, home to many magnificent 17th century
gardens. Drive south west from Apeldoorn and take the A1 highway west all the way to Amsterdam. Stop by the
charming village of Hoogland and historic towns of Bussum and Naarden along the way. This area features a
series of extraordinary homes and high end restaurants. As you travel along the A1, the landscape will evolve as
you approach Amsterdam. The colourful forests, fields and farms which make up much of the first section of
this drive will slowly change into a
scene covered with lakes and
canals. Upon arrival in
Amsterdam, you’ll find an endless
supply of entertainment and
attractions to keep you busy in
this famous Dutch city.

Self Drive Tours: Northern Netherlands

Leewarden to Amsterdam
Begin this drive in the delightful town of Leeuwarden and
travel west on either the A31 or N359, which both lead to
the A7/E22. Along this route you’ll pass lush green pastures
and serene waterways. Continue west toward the village of
Zurich, where you’ll come upon the Afsluitdijk, an enormous
causeway and dam built in the 1920s. Covering a distance
of 32km, you’ll have nothing but water as far as the eye can
see. When you reach the other side, continue south on the
E22 and take in the immense beauty of the Dutch
countryside as you make your way to the celebrated city of
Amsterdam.

Groningen to the West Frisian Islands
From Groningen, drive west along the A7 through the scenic countryside of the north. On this drive, you’ll pass
through a number of charming towns and cities such as Leek, Marum and Drachten. These towns along the way
to are great to explore and spend an evening, or just make a nice pit stop. In Drachten, you’ll have the option of
heading north west and passing through Leeuwarden, or continuing west along the A7 and driving through the
gorgeous lake district around Sneek.
When you reach Harlingen, it’s time to
leave the rental car behind and head out
to the West Frisian Islands by ferry. You
can choose from several islands,
including Vlieland, Terschelling and
Ameland, all of which are quiet scenic
destinations, with few people and plenty
of green fields and sand dunes.

Money Matters

Currency
Euro (EUR €) = 100 cents (¢) Notes are in denominations of €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, €5. Coins are
in denominations of €1 and €2, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1 cent coins.

Currency Exchange
Currency can be exchanged in the Netherlands at major banks, post offices and Bureaux de Change offices.
Hours of business may vary, depending on the bank, but most will be open from 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday
through Friday. Major banks and post offices may be open on Saturday. Some banks will stay open late on
Thursday and Friday evenings.

Credit & Debit Cards
Most major credit and debit cards are accepted in the Netherlands. Confirm details of any international fees
your credit card company or bank may impose before you travel.

ATMs
You will find ATMs in all major cities and larger towns in the Netherlands. If you’re travelling through small
towns it is wise to take out cash before you depart. While it is not wise to carry large amounts of cash, you may
find smaller businesses throughout the Netherlands that are cash only, so it is always a good idea to have some
change on hand.

Tax
Food in the Netherlands is taxed at 6%, while other goods are taxed at 21%. If you make a purchase over
€50.00 which you are bringing out of the Netherlands, you may furnish receipts for these goods to claim your
tax back at the airport upon departure.

Tipping
While tipping is not required in the Netherlands, it is quite common in restaurants, hotels and taxis. Rounding
up a bill to the nearest amount in full euros is a common practice and a tip of 10% is customary if you receive
excellent service. Many public toilets will have an attendant who typically receives a tip of €0.50.

Stay Healthy & Stay Safe

Stay Healthy
There are relatively few health risks for travel in the Netherlands and medical care and hospitals are excellent.
The Australian Government has a reciprocal health care agreement with the Government of The Netherlands
which gives Australians access to free emergency medical services, but does not provide for any ongoing
treatment of existing health conditions. Please note that this does not replace the need for your own travel
insurance. Your comprehensive travel insurance will cover any medical costs including medical evacuation in
case of emergency. Be sure to clarify the details of your travel health insurance prior to departure.

Stay Safe
Germany is regarded as a very safe country to visit. However, standard safety precautions should be taken to
avoid dangerous areas or high risk situations. Never carrying more cash than necessary and keep to well-lit
areas at night. It is always a good idea to check the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website
for safety information specific to your destination before you go. In the unlikely event that your credit or debit
cards are lost or stolen, notify your bank and credit card companies immediately.
In case of an emergency, dial 112 for medical, fire and police.
