BASIC THEORY OF DRIVING

PART A
DRIVING LICENCES

INTRODUCTION
The “Basic Theory of Driving” handbook is essential reading for all road users in Singapore, which comprise the pedestrians, cyclists,
motorcyclists and drivers. It covers The Highway Code, which includes the traffic rules, traffic regulations, traffic signs and signals,
and it aims to educate and promote road safety for the road users. Many of the rules and regulations in the Code are legal requirements,
and if you disobey them, you are committing a traffic offence. You may be fined and given demerit points on your driving licence,
which may lead to suspension or revocation of your driving licence, or you may be disqualified by the Courts from driving. Knowing
and applying the traffic rules and regulations in The Highway Code could significantly help to reduce road accidents, casualties and
fatalities on our roads.

WHAT IS A DRIVING LICENCE?
1

A driving licence is a legal document issued by the Traffic Police under the Road Traffic Act, which identifies the licensee, sets
out the class(es) of vehicle(s) which he/she may legally drive and states such restrictions or conditions as may apply as well as
the period for which the licence is valid, where applicable.

FITNESS TO DRIVE
2

In order to qualify for a driving licence to drive or ride a motor vehicle on the roads in Singapore, an applicant:
(i) Must be at least 18 years old;
(ii) Must have passed the test of competence to drive;
(iii) Must not be suffering from mental disorder;
(iv) Must not be suffering from epilepsy;
(v) Must not be liable to sudden attacks of disabling giddiness or fainting;
(vi) Must be able to read at a distance of 25 metres (with the aid of glasses, if worn) a series of 6 letters and figures in white on
a black background of the same size and arrangement as those prescribed for the identification mark of a motor vehicle; and
(vii) Must be able to distinguish the colours red, amber and green from a distance of 25 metres.

TEST OF COMPETENCE TO DRIVE
4

An applicant for a new class of licence must pass the test of competence to drive, which includes the theory and/or practical
driving/riding tests:
(a) Basic Theory Test (BTT)
The Basic Theory Test (BTT) is designed to test your knowledge of the traffic rules, traffic regulations, traffic signs and
signals as well as general road safety. The testing curriculum for BTT is broadly covered in the handbook titled “The Official
Handbook - Basic Theory of Driving” and all learner drivers and riders must obtain a pass for BTT before they can proceed
to take the advanced theory test i.e. the Final Theory Test (FTT) or the Riding Theory Test (RTT).
(b) Final Theory Test (FTT)
After passing the BTT, and if you want to obtain a motorcar driving licence (Class 3 or 3A), you must pass your FTT before
you can take the Practical Driving Test. The FTT aims to test your knowledge on driving safety aspects and proper techniques
of driving, as well as your interaction with other road users whilst driving on the roads. After you have passed your FTT, you
are required to pass the Practical Driving Test within two years, failing which, you will have to retake and pass your FTT
again before you can apply for another Practical Driving Test. The testing curriculum for FTT is broadly covered in the
handbook titled “The Official Handbook - Final Theory of Driving”.
(c) Riding Theory Test (RTT)
After passing the BTT, and if you want to obtain a motorcycle driving licence (Class 2B), you must pass your RTT before
you can take the Practical Riding Test. The RTT aims to test your knowledge on riding safety aspects and proper techniques
of riding, as well as your interaction with other road users whilst riding on the roads. After you have passed your RTT, you
are required to pass the Practical Riding Test within one year, failing which, you have to retake and pass your RTT again
before you can apply for another Practical Riding Test.
(d) Practical Driving / Riding Test
The Practical Driving / Riding Test will be conducted by a Driving Examiner appointed by the Traffic Police. You must
provide a motor vehicle which is suitable for the test, in good mechanical condition and properly insured against third-party
risks.

5

In order to book and take a theory or practical driving / riding test, an applicant must fulfil the following eligibility requirements
at the date of booking or date of taking his/her test:
(a) He/She has not accumulated more than 12 demerit points;
(b) He/She is not under suspension or Court disqualification or is not within the period of one year from the date of revocation
of his/her driving licence;
(c) He/She is not under police investigation; and
(d) He/She has not committed 2 or more offences of failing to display a distinguishing mark (i.e. Probation Plate) during his/her
period of probation as a new driver for his/her other new class of driving licence.

PROVISIONAL DRIVING LICENCE (PDL)
6

After passing your BTT, you may apply for a Provisional Driving Licence (PDL) to start learning to drive or ride on the roads
with your driving instructor. A PDL is valid for 2 years from the date of grant and can be renewed subsequently for every 2 years.

7

As a PDL holder, you must display two 18 cm square ‘L’ plates, in a conspicuous position on both the front and back of your
motor vehicle during your driving lessons and driving tests, as well as be insured against third-party risk, during your driving tests
and driving lessons. You can only drive whilst under the supervision of your licensed driving instructor or driving school’s driving
instructor.

8

To apply for a PDL, an applicant must fulfil the following eligibility requirements at the date of the application:
(a) He/She has not accumulated more than 12 demerit points;
(b) He/She has passed his/her BTT;
(c) He/She must be able to read at a distance of 25 metres (with the aid of glasses, if worn) a series of 6 letters and figures in
white on a black background of the same size and arrangement as those prescribed for the identification mark of a motor
vehicle; and
(d) He/She must be able to distinguish the colours red, amber and green from a distance of 25 metres.

VALIDITY OF DRIVING LICENCE
9

If you are a Singapore Citizen or a Permanent Resident, your driving licence will be valid for your lifetime. However, if you are
a foreigner and a holder of a work pass granted by the Ministry of Manpower (for example: Employment Pass, S-Pass, Work
Permit, Dependent Pass issued with restriction as to his/her period of stay in Singapore), your driving licence will be valid for a
period up to 5 years.

BASIC THEORY OF DRIVING

4

PART A
DRIVING LICENCES
‘NEW’ DRIVERS
10 New drivers are motorists who hold a new class of driving licence for less than one year from the date of grant of licence. They
shall be under probation for one year from the date of grant of the new driving licence to them.
11 During the one year probation period, all new Class 2B, Class 3/3A and Class 3C/3CA drivers are required to display a
distinguishing mark (i.e. Probation Plate) at the front and rear of their vehicles when driving.
In the case of a Class 2B motor vehicle, the Probation Plate should be displayed:
(a) directly above or below the headlamp; and
(b) directly above or below the rear licence plate.
For a Class 3, 3A, 3C & 3CA motor vehicle which is constructed with a front and a rear windscreen, the
Probation Plate should be displayed;
(a) at the top right portion of the front windscreen; and
(b) at the top right portion of the rear windscreen, as seen from the outside of the vehicle;

Probation Plate

12 Those who fail to display the Probation Plate will be fined. Repeat offenders with at least 2 offences of failing to display the
Probation Plate during their one year probation period will have their licence revoked.
A new driver who accumulates 13 or more demerit points during the one year probation period will also have his/her new driving
licence revoked.

DRIVER IMPROVEMENT POINTS SYSTEM (DIPS)
13 Singapore’s demerit points system, named the Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS), was introduced on 1 March 1983.
14 DIPS is designed to identify and rehabilitate errant drivers through a system of rewards and punishments. Errant motorists are
thus encouraged to improve their driving behaviours on the roads with incentives to expunge their demerit points and previous
suspension record as well as remission of suspension period.
Key Features Of DIPS
Suspension Of Driving Licence
New or Probationary Motorists
15 For a new motorist who is under one year probation from the date of grant of his/her driving licence, his/her new driving licence
will be revoked and become invalid when he/she accumulates 13 or more demerit points during his/her probation period. The
licence holder will have to retake all the necessary driving tests (theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride again and
can only retake the driving tests one year after the revocation is effected.
Non-Probationary Motorists
16 For a motorist who has no previous suspension record with Traffic Police, if he/she has accumulated 24 or more demerit points
within 24 consecutive months, his/her driving licence will become liable for the 1st suspension of a period of 12 weeks.
17 For a motorist who has previous suspension records with Traffic Police, if he/she has accumulated 12 or more demerit points
within 12 consecutive months, his/her driving licence will become liable for the subsequent suspension.
18 For subsequent suspensions after the 1st suspension, the suspension periods are:
(a) 2nd suspension : 24 weeks;
(b) 3rd suspension : 1 year;
(c) 4th suspension : 2 years; and
(d) 5th suspension (onwards) : 3 years.
19 Where the suspension period lasts a year or longer (i.e. 3rd suspension onwards), the driving licence will be revoked and become
invalid. The licence holder will have to retake all the necessary driving tests (theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride
again.
20 Motorists liable for 1st and 2nd suspensions will be offered a retraining course to correct their driving behaviour. If they take and
pass the retraining course, they will be given a remission on their suspension period:
(a) For 1st suspension, the suspension period will be reduced from 12 weeks to 4 weeks. If none of their traffic offences leading
to their 1st suspension was involved in a traffic accident, their suspension period will be further reduced to 1 week; and
(b) For 2nd suspension, it will be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 weeks.
21 There is no offer of retraining course and remission for 3rd and subsequent suspensions.
22 During the suspension period, the licence holder’s photocard driving licence must be surrendered to Traffic Police. For 1st and
2nd suspensions, the licence holder’s photocard driving licence will be returned to him/her upon the expiry of the suspension
period.

Multiple Notice Of Demerit Points Accumulated
23 Motorists will be notified and updated of their demerit point status after settling every offence where demerit points are awarded.
The intent of the letter is to pre-warn the licence holders to improve their driving behaviour, and encourage them to remain
offence-free for 12 months for their demerit points to be expunged; otherwise they may face the consequence of becoming liable
for suspension.
Incentives For Good Driving Behaviour
24 A licence holder who maintains a 12-month period free of scheduled offences from the date of the last scheduled offence
committed will have all his/her previous demerit points removed from his/her record.
25 A licence holder who maintains a 24-month period free of scheduled offences from the date of expiry of the last suspension will
also have all his/her previous suspension(s) removed from his/her record, i.e. he/she will be treated similar to a driver with no
previous suspension record.
26 Motorists with a clean driving record for a continuous period of three years will enjoy a discount over and above the usual NoClaim Bonus when they renew their insurance policy with participating insurance companies. They must also not have made any
claims on their vehicles’ insurance for the past three years.
27 The public can check on a driver’s driving licence status and demerit points accumulated via Singapore Police Force e-Services
at www.police.gov.sg/e-services.

Expressway Monitoring and Advisory Systems (EMAS)

EXPRESSWAY MONITORING AND ADVISORY SYSTEM (EMAS)
44 Motorists should look out for these three types of electronic signboards when travelling towards and along the expressways; and
selected major arterial roads.

(a) TRAVEL TIME DISPLAY (TTD)
These electronic advisory signboards are placed at various entrances leading to the expressways. They provide estimated
travel times to selected exits on the expressways from the point the motorist enters a particular expressway. For example, if
a motorist enters CTE, he/she will notice the TTD as below. The estimated travel time to the expressway exit of Ang Mo Kio
Avenue 1 is about 5 minutes from the point he/she enters CTE.
The estimated travel times are displayed in colour. Green indicates the travel time displayed is up to 50% more than normal
travel time, yellow indicates the travel time displayed is between 50% to 125% more than normal travel time and red indicates
the travel time displayed is more than 125% of normal travel time.
Messages are also displayed on this signboard pertaining to incidents on the expressway. For example, the message
“ACCIDENT on CTE (SLE)” displayed on the TTD below informs motorists that there is an accident occurring on the CTE
in the direction towards SLE.

Accident on
CTE (SLE)

Estimated travel times of journeys to
destinations
a) To Ang Mo Kio 1 exit is normal
(green colour);
b) To SLE exit is 50% more than the
normal travel time (yellow colour); and
c) To Woodlands Ave 2 exit is 125%
more than the normal travel time (red
colour)

Displayed destinations / expressway exits

In the TTD below, the travel times are displayed in a single colour. The text “ACCIDENT” toggles with “ON CTE (AYE)”
to inform motorists that there is accident occurrence on CTE in the direction of AYE. TTDs like these will be phased out.

(b) TRAFFIC INFORMATION DISPLAY (TID) ON EXPRESSWAYS / SELECTED MAJOR ARTERIAL
ROADS
These large displays found along the expressways and selected major arterial roads display traffic information in text and
simple graphic display up to seven colours. They inform motorists of traffic conditions ahead. A red cross indicates location
with reference to the expressway exits or major road names labelled. A flashing red bar indicates road closure ahead. TIDs
may also display information on incident type, lane(s) affected, congestion information, travel time information or other
traffic advisory messages.
For example, if there is an accident on ECP in the direction towards Airport between Bayshore and Tampines exits, the TID
below will alert motorists in advance for them to react accordingly.

The Keep-Left Rules / Lane Discipline / Overtaking

THE KEEP-LEFT RULE
61 When driving along two-way streets, keep well to the left and as near as practicable to the boundary of the road, except when you
intend to overtake or turn right. Do not hog the middle of the road. This applies to dual-carriageways as well.
62 You must not cross the centre line at bends, near the crest of a rise or anywhere else where you cannot clearly see the road ahead.
63 Sometimes your path of travel may be obstructed by road works, parked vehicles etc. In such circumstances, to avoid the
obstruction, take extra care to ensure that your intended path is safe and clear before you move to the right. You may cross the
centre line if the roads are narrow.

LANE DISCIPLINE
64 You must obey the directions indicated by arrows marked in the lanes. See illustration below. You must not change lanes suddenly
as you may inconvenience or endanger other motorists. When changing lanes, give sufficient warning of your intention. Always
signal in advance. Failure to do so could cause an accident.
65 In traffic hold-ups, do not “jump the queue”. Trying to get
ahead of others by squeezing between lanes and overtaking
recklessly is courting disaster. Always be patient and have
consideration for other road users.
66 Well before you reach a junction, make sure that you get into
the correct lane for whichever direction you wish to take.
67 On a two-lane carriageway, keep to the lefthand lane except
when overtaking.
68 On a three-lane carriageway, you may keep to the centre lane
when the left-hand lane is occupied by slower moving
vehicles. The outer (right-hand) lane is for overtaking and
emergency vehicles only.

OVERTAKING
69 Never overtake unless you can do so without endangering yourself or others. Be especially careful at night, and in heavy rain and
mist. When visibility is poor, it becomes more difficult to judge speed and distance.
70 Always overtake on the right. There are, however, a few exceptions to this rule when you can overtake on the left:
(a) When the driver in front has signalled his/her intention to turn right.
(b) When you want to turn left at a junction.
(c) When traffic is moving slowly in queues and vehicles in the lanes on your right are moving more slowly than you are.
(d) On one-way streets (but not dual-carriageways) where vehicles may pass on either side.
71 After overtaking, return to the appropriate lane on the road as soon as it is safe to do so, but do not cut in sharply in front of the
vehicle you have just overtaken.
72 Do not overtake when you are at, or when you are approaching:
(a) A pedestrian crossing.
(b) A road junction.
(c) A corner or bend.
(d) The brow of a hill.
(e) Double white lines.
73 Do not overtake:
(a) Where the road narrows.
(b) If it would force another vehicle to swerve or reduce speed.
(c) If in doubt.
74 Do not increase your speed while being overtaken. Slow down if necessary to let the overtaking vehicle pass.
75 In the following cases, overtaking is dangerous and should not be attempted:
(a) When the car in front of you is about to overtake the car in front of it.
(b) When the car in front is changing from the left to the right lane in order to make a right turn.
(c) When you have to get into the path of oncoming traffic in order to overtake.

Road-Hogging / Speed Limits /
The “Give Way Rule” At Road Junctions

ROAD-HOGGING
77 Road-Hogging is driving at an unreasonably slow speed on the road especially on the right-hand or along the centre of the road.
Road-Hogging hinders the flow of traffic behind and may cause other vehicles to pass dangerously on the left. Motorists who
travel at a slow speed should keep to the left side of the road; this applies especially to small capacity motorcycles, goods vehicles
and lorries. You should only use the right hand lane when overtaking or when you are about to turn right or make a U-turn.

SPEED LIMITS
78 Unless otherwise stated, the speed limit of all roads in Singapore is 50 km/h. Do not exceed the speed limit of your vehicle or the
road, whichever is the lesser.
79 Always obey the “Reduce Speed Now” sign.

THE ‘GIVE WAY’ RULE AT ROAD JUNCTIONS
80 When approaching a junction with a major road, slow down gradually and give way to traffic on the major road. Where there is
a “STOP” sign, stop before the stop-line.
81 At an uncontrolled junction where there are no traffic lights, “GIVE WAY” sign or “STOP” sign:
(a) If you are going straight across the junction, you must give way to traffic going straight from the right.

(b) If you are turning right, you must give way to traffic going straight from all directions, as well as traffic turning right from
the right and traffic turning left from the opposite direction.

(c) If you are turning left, you must give way to traffic going straight from the right.

TRAFFIC RULES & REGULATIONS

The “Give Way Rule” At Road Junctions / Roundabouts

82 At a junction, look right, then left, then right again. Do not proceed until you are sure that it is safe to do so. Do not rely on signals
to go ahead given by unauthorised persons.
83 Well before you turn right at a junction, take full account of the position and movement of traffic behind you. When it is safe to
do so, signal your intention and take up a position just left of the middle of a two-way street or to the extreme right lane of a oneway street. Wait there until there is a safe distance between you and any approaching vehicle before you complete your turn.
84 When turning right into a two-way street, turn into the lane just left of the centre line of the road you are turning into.
85 When turning right into a one-way street, turn into the extreme right lane of the road you are turning into.
86 If you intend to turn left, keep to the left, signal in good time, and do not swing out to the right before or after making the turn.
87 When a vehicle turns, the rear nearside wheel tends to pull closer to the kerb. So when making a turn, take special care not to
brush against pedestrians, bicycles or motorcycles.

Notice the wide difference between
the arcs that the front and rear
nearside wheels take when making
a turn.

ROUNDABOUTS
88 Slow down when approaching a roundabout and give way to traffic on your right.
89 The general rule is that:
(a) traffic from lane A as in the illustration goes to ‘A’.
(b) traffic from lane B goes to ‘B’.
(c) traffic from lane C goes to ‘C’.

REMEMBER - Traffic coming from your right takes priority over you.
Rules for Motorists
You must always give way to traffic approaching from your right. You are advised to exercise caution at all times, and decide as
early as possible which exit you need to take. Take note of and act on all the information available to you from traffic signs, traffic
lights and road markings that direct you into the correct lane. Always remember that you have to:(a) Give clear signals showing your intention in good time;
(b) Obey the right-hand rule;
(c) Not inconvenience other drivers;
(d) Use your mirror intelligently to see that you do not obstruct the path of vehicles behind you; and
(e) Show consideration to other road users in the interest of road safety.

Driving On Expressways / Yellow-Box Junctions

DRIVING ON EXPRESSWAYS
90 Do not drive, move or stop on road shoulder or verge unless in the event of a breakdown, accident or emergency.
91 Vehicles which have a speed limit of 60 km/h and below shall be driven along the left hand lane of the expressway.
92 Cycling, skating and walking are prohibited on expressways.

YELLOW-BOX JUNCTIONS
93 It is an offence for any driver to drive his/her vehicle into a junction marked with a yellow box and cause obstruction even if the
lights are in his/her favour. However, there are certain situations in which a driver or rider will not be penalised for entering the
yellow-box junction.
(a) Situation One
The first is when the turning vehicles in a box-junction do not block other vehicles. Only drivers of turning vehicles A, B and C
and NOT those marked X may enter the yellow box when their exit lanes from it are blocked by other vehicles. Should the traffic
lights change to red, vehicles A, B and C would not cause any obstruction to other vehicles. However, vehicles marked X would
be obstructing traffic should the lights change and the drivers will be penalised, as such they should wait behind the stop-line at
‘Y’.

(b) Situation Two
The second situation is when motorists are waiting in the yellow box while trying to turn right in the face of oncoming traffic.
Drivers of vehicles marked A, B and C can remain in the box until a suitable opportunity arises for them to complete their turns.
Should the lights turn red against them, they should proceed to complete their turn and clear the yellow box junction.

(c) Situation Three
The third situation is when motorists are waiting in a yellow box junction while making left or right turns because of pedestrians
crossing the road. The diagram shows that the drivers of vehicles A, B, C, D and E may enter the yellow box even when they are
prevented from executing their turns by pedestrians using the crossings.

U-Turns / Stopping And Parking

U-TURNS
94 Do not make a U-turn at any road
intersection, junction or any opening in a
road divider except where a U-turn sign is
located.
95 Always negotiate a U-turn carefully,
especially if roadside trees or hedges are
obstructing your view of oncoming traffic.
As you turn, be alert for any vehicles,
especially motorcycles, which may be
turning together with you on your right.

STOPPING AND PARKING
96 Do not park or let your vehicle wait:
(a) At a bend, the brow of a hill or a bridge.
(b) On a footway or cycle track.
(c) Near traffic lights or pedestrian
crossings.
(d) On a main road or on a road carrying fast
moving traffic.
(e) Opposite or nearly opposite another
stationary vehicle across the road, or
other obstructions (eg. road repairs).
(f) Abreast of another vehicle.
(g) Within 6 metres (20 feet) of an intersection or junction of any road or street (as shown in the diagram below).
(h) Within 9 metres (30 feet) of a bus stop (from the edge of a yellow demarcated box or from the tip of a bus bay except when
the vehicle breaks down owing to a defect in the vehicle or its tyres).
(i) Within 3 meters (10 feet) on either side of fire hydrant.
(j) Where it will obstruct any entrance.
(k) Facing oncoming traffic.
(l) Along any slip road.
(m) On a flyover, underpass or ramp leading to a

(p) In any designated taxi stop (except taxis).
(q) In any taxi stand (except taxis).
(r) In any bus terminus (except omnibuses).
(s) Within “No Waiting” zone
(t) Within “No Stopping” zone
(Note: Parking means to bring the vehicle to a stationary position and cause it to wait other than for the immediate picking up or
letting down of passengers.)
97 Before opening a door of a vehicle, make sure that it will not endanger or inconvenience anybody on the road or foot-path. Get
out on the side nearest to the kerb whenever it is possible.
98 When you have to stop, pull in as close as possible to the edge of the road.
99 Whenever you park, remember to:
(a) Turn off the engine and engage the hand-brake.
(b) Put your car into reverse gear if facing downhill and into low gear if facing uphill.
(c) Remove the ignition key.
(d) Lock the steering mechanism or activate the burglar alarm if your car is fitted with one.
(e) Wind up the windows and lock the doors.
(f) Keep your valuables in the boot or in a place where they cannot be seen.
100 Remember that you are not allowed to leave any broken-down or wrecked vehicle on any public road. If your vehicle breaks down
on the road, push it into a break-down bay or as close to the side of the road as possible. Switch on the hazard warning lights even
during daylight and place a reflective warning triangle at least 20 metres behind the vehicle. Arrange for it to be towed away
immediately so as not to cause obstruction to the flow of traffic.

Seat Belts / Lights

SEAT BELTS
101 All persons travelling in vehicles, irrespective of their age,
should be appropriately belted up. Adults below the height of
1.35m shall use booster seats or approved adjustable seat belts
to lower the risk of injury in the event of an accident.
102 A composition fine of $120 and 3 demerit points will be
awarded for failing to belt up.

LIGHTS
103 At night (between 7.00pm and 7.00am) you must drive with your headlights on.
104 At night always drive well within the limits of your
headlights. Beware of pedestrians standing on the central
divider because it is difficult to see them when dazzled by the
lights of oncoming vehicles.
105 Use dipped headlights at night in built-up areas and during
rainy weather.
Pedestrian is invisible to driver

106 On unlit roads always use your high beam. Dip your headlights when meeting other vehicles and cyclists. If you are dazzled by
the lights of another vehicle, slow down and stop if necessary.

Lights / Alcohol /
Light Goods Vehicles / Height Limits

108 In the daytime whenever visibility is poor or if it is raining, switch on your headlights. This is to enable other road users to see
your vehicle. Switching on your headlights will not in any way affect your fuel consumption.
109 It is advisable when parking in unlit or poorly lit roads at night to leave your side or parking lights on.
110 Try not to look directly at the headlights of oncoming vehicles but direct your vision slightly to the left. This technique can save
you from momentary blindness.
111 Always keep a look-out for flashes from the brake lights of vehicles in front.
112 When approaching a curve or intersection with poor visibility, it is a good idea to flash your headlights to let pedestrians and
oncoming cyclists and motorists know that you are heading into the curve or intersection.
113 It is unsafe to drive with the interior lights on as they reduce your external visibility. Motorcyclists are required to switch on their
headlights throughout the day.

ALCOHOL
114 Alcohol, when even a small quantity has been consumed, makes you less safe on the roads. The safe rule is IF YOU DRINK,
DON’T DRIVE. The same applies to drugs even when taken medicinally.
115 The prescribed legal limit for blood alcohol content is 80 milligrammes (mg) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of blood while
that for breath is 35 microgrammes (ug) of alcohol per 100 millilitres (ml) of breath. Any person caught driving with blood or
breath alcohol content which exceeds the prescribed limit will be charged in court for drink driving. A person can also be charged
for drink driving even when the blood or breath alcohol content is below the legal limit if there is evidence to show that he/she
was unable to control the vehicle because of alcoholic intoxication. The penalty for drink driving is a fine of between $1,000 and
$5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months. There is also a mandatory 1-year disqualification in respect of the offender’s
driving licence. A repeat offender will face a mandatory jail sentence not exceeding 1 year.

LIGHT GOODS VEHICLES
116 All lorries used for carrying workers on the carriage deck must be fitted with canopies and higher side railings.
117 The load on any vehicle on a road should always be securely fastened.
118 The front passenger seat(s) in the lorry’s cabin must be occupied before workers can be carried on the rear carriage deck.
119 Lorry owners who wish to use their lorries to carry their workers must display a Maximum Passenger Capacity (MPC) label on
the right side of the lorry’s rear tailboard indicating the maximum number of workers that can be transported when the carriage
deck is empty.
120 For safety, when workers are carried in lorries, they should be made to sit down properly and the maximum allowable height of
a seated worker shall not be more than 1.1 metres measured from the carriage deck.
121 The vehicle must not carry an excess number of workers based on the minimum deck space requirement of 0.372 square metres
(or 4 square feet) per seated worker. If goods or equipment are also transported, the number of workers that may be carried is to
be reduced according to the remaining floor area available.
122 When transporting workers on the carriage deck, the vehicle must not travel faster than the posted road speed limit or the vehicle
speed limit of 60 km/h, whichever is lower.

HEIGHT LIMITS
123 Anyone who drives a vehicle with overall height exceeding 4.5m without police escort is committing an offence.
Avoid collision with an overhead structure in 4 steps
(a) Ensure vehicle height is less than 4.5m. Apply for a police escort if vehicle height exceeds 4.5m.
(b) Plan your route before driving off.
(c) Obey speed and height limits.
(d) Stop and seek alternative route if you:
(i) are diverted from your original route
(ii) are lost
(iii) realise that your route is obstructed by a road structure lower than your vehicle’s height during your journey.

Use Of Mobile Communication Device While Driving

USE OF MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE WHILE DRIVING
(“Use”, in relation to a mobile communication device, means to hold it in at least one hand while operating any of its functions)
124 It is an offence to use a mobile communication devices [including mobile telephone and any hand held devices (e.g. tablets,
walkie-talkies, handheld gaming consoles, etc) which are designed or capable of being used for a communicative function) when
driving. Should you need to use the mobile communication device while driving, you should drive to a safe place such as a carpark
and use it when you are stationary. Communicative function, in this context, refers to any of the following functions:
(a) Sending or receiving oral or written messages;
(b) Sending or receiving electronic documents;
(c) Sending or receiving still or moving images;
(d) Sending or receiving audio or video files; and
(e) Providing access to the internet
125 Any driver caught using a mobile communication device whilst driving will be charged in court. The penalty for this offence is a
fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both. The offender’s driving licence is also likely to be
disqualified.
126 Typical scenarios of using a mobile communication device while driving includes driving with one hand holding a mobile
communication device and communicating with another person on that device while the vehicle is in motion; texting with a mobile
communication device, dialling a phone number or pressing a button to receive a call while holding the mobile communication
device are also against the law. Using hands free devices, such as wireless or wired headsets, is acceptable unless the driver is
holding on to the mobile communication device while using the hands free device while the vehicle is in motion.
In short, an offence is committed if the driver satisfies all the 3 conditions below:
(a) At least one hand is holding a mobile communication device; and
(b) Driver is using any function of the mobile communication device; and
(c) The motor vehicle is in motion.

Moving Off / Mirrors And Signals /
Driving Along / Tailgating / Safe Following Distance

MOVING OFF
127 Before you move off, fasten your seat belt and look in the mirrors. Give the proper signal, look around to check on traffic and
pedestrians. Move off only when you can do so safely and without causing inconvenience to other road users. Give way to passing
and overtaking vehicles.

MIRRORS AND SIGNALS
128 Mirrors should be checked before moving off, slowing down, stopping, changing lane, overtaking and making any turn. You
should also cultivate the habit of checking the mirrors every 5 to 10 seconds while driving along.
129 The areas on the right and left of your vehicle which cannot be viewed in your mirrors are known as “blind spots”. You have to
turn your head and look over your shoulder to the left or the right to check for traffic in the “blind spots” before changing lane,
overtaking, turning and stopping.
130 Always give clear signals well in advance of your intentions (at least 3 seconds) before your manoeuvre so that other road users
can interact safely.

DRIVING ALONG
131 Constantly adjust your speed to the conditions of the road on which you are travelling. Such adjustment will enable you to stop
in any emergency without skidding or losing control of your vehicle.
132 A good driver automatically reduces speed when:
(a) Entering a built-up area.
(b) Approaching a school or a stationary bus with children alighting from or boarding it.
(c) Travelling on narrow winding roads.
(d) Approaching children who are playing.
(e) Approaching a bend, brow of a hill, or other obstruction that limits his/her view.
(f) The road surface is wet.

TAILGATING
133 Tailgating, or following too closely behind another vehicle is a dangerous practice. If the vehicle in front stops suddenly, an
accident is inevitable since you will not be able to stop in time. Tailgating also makes the driver in front nervous and can cause
him/her to be involved in an accident.

SAFE FOLLOWING DISTANCE
134 To be able to stop with an appropriate space between your vehicle and the vehicle in front, you must allow at least one car length
for every 16km/h of your speed.

CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

The ‘Two-Second’ Rule / Stopping Distance

THE ‘TWO-SECOND’ RULE
135 A simple way to ensure a safe gap between you and the vehicle in front is to use the ‘two-second’ rule. As the vehicle in front of
you passes a stationary object, such as a lamp post on the side of the road, start counting to yourself ‘one-thousand-and-one, one
thousand-and-two’. This will take you 2 seconds. If you reach the same spot before you finish these eight words, you are following
too closely and it is necessary to slow down. This rule will keep you at a safe following distance and will apply to all types of
vehicles at any speed.

(Vehicle ‘A’ does not pass the lamp post before counting “one-thousand-and-one, one-thousand-and-two”. Thus vehicle
‘A’ is at a safe following distance from vehicle ‘B’)
136 Always watch for the brake lights of the car immediately in front and the traffic ahead of the car in front.

STOPPING DISTANCE
137 It takes a longer distance to stop a moving vehicle than most people think. It is therefore prudent to study the chart below and
remember that your stopping distance is approximately the sum of your reaction distance and braking distance. These distances
will increase with the driving speeds of your vehicle.

138 The braking distance will also increase when the road is wet, or if the tyre treads are worn, or when the car is fully loaded. Reaction
time will also increase if a driver is tired or if he/she has consumed alcohol.

Emergency Vehicles / General Safe Driving

REVERSING
139 Before you reverse, make sure that there are no children or other pedestrians or obstructions in the blind areas behind you.
140 Do not reverse from a side road/minor road into a main road.
141 If your view to the rear is restricted, get help when reversing.

SAFETY OF PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS
142 Pedestrians have the right-of-way at Pedestrian Crossings.
143 When approaching a pedestrian crossing, slow down and do not overtake other vehicles.
144 When approaching a pedestrian crossing, ALWAYS –
(a) be ready to slow down or stop so as to give way to pedestrians;
(b) signal to other drivers your intention to slow down or stop;
(c) allow yourself more time to stop when the road is wet.
145 At a pedestrian crossing controlled by traffic signals or by a policeman, give way to pedestrians who are still crossing even when
the signal allows vehicles to move.
146 Stop, when signalled to do so by a school patrol warden showing a “STOP-Children” sign.
147 Watch for pedestrians who come out suddenly from behind stationary vehicles and other obstructions. Be very careful near schools
and bus stops.
148 Pedestrians using rural roads tend to be less “road-wise”. Watch out for them.
149 When you are passing a pedestrian or cyclist, always maintain as wide a distance from him/her as possible and drive slowly.
150 When driving across a muddy section of the road or through a puddle, you should slow down to avoid splashing muddy water
onto pedestrians.

EMERGENCY VEHICLES
151 Ambulances ferry the sick and injured to hospitals. Fire Engines help put out fires, and Police Vehicles carry police personnel
whose presence is much needed in an emergency. Obstructing the passage of any such vehicle could mean the difference between
life and death for someone, somewhere. If you encounter any of them on the road with sirens and/or seeing the flashing beacon
lights, give way by pulling in to the left or right side of the road depending on the circumstances.
DO
(a) Pull to the nearest edge of the roadway and come to a complete stop if necessary, until all emergency vehicles have passed.
(b) Be alert to the approach of an emergency vehicle.
(c) Switch on your direction signal when pulling off the road. This sends a message to the emergency vehicle operator that the
driver is aware of his/her presence.
DO NOT
(a) Block any intersection (even when attempting to give way to an emergency vehicle), as it is dangerous.
(b) Follow closely behind an emergency vehicle responding to an emergency.
(c) Stop on a bridge, curve or crest of a hill; instead, switch on your directional signal and proceed forward until you can safely
pull over and come to a complete stop.
(d) Slam on your brakes or stop directly in front of an emergency vehicle.

GENERAL SAFE DRIVING
152 When you are driving, keep your attention on the road ahead, except for necessary and frequent glances at the rear view mirror,
wing mirrors and panel of the car. Do not turn your head to talk to your passengers or to light a cigarette. Children should not be
allowed to obstruct or distract the driver and parents should train them not to do so.
153 Be careful when driving on steel plates laid on unfinished roadworks because these are extremely slippery, especially when they
are wet.
154 Avoid driving through floods as there is a danger that brake malfunction may subsequently occur. If unavoidable, pump the brake
pedal repeatedly after emerging from flood waters so as to dry the brakes.

155 HOW TO REACT TO ANIMALS CROSSING THE ROAD
(a) Slow down when driving next to nature areas, and where wildlife crossings are indicated.
(b) Be alert and slow down if you see any animals crossing the road ahead of you.
(c) Be extra cautious at dawn and dusk as this is the peak period for animal movements.
(d) Scan the road shoulders ahead of you. Look for reflecting eyes or animals walking along the side of the road.
(e) Even though animals may be walking along the side of the road as your vehicle approaches, they may panic and attempt to
flee by crossing the road. Slow down as you approach.
(f) If collision with the animal is unavoidable, apply the brakes firmly and remain in your lane.
(g) If you have a collision with an animal and it is causing an obstruction to other road users; you are required to stop your
vehicle, turn on your hazard light and notify the Traffic Police at 999.
(h) Refrain from touching or moving the injured animal unless you are confident to do so; as it may still be able to defend
itself. In the event you are able to move the animal place it at the road shoulder or grass verge ensuring it does not cause any
further obstruction to road users. Update Traffic Police at 999 once you have successfully moved the animal.

(a) Adjust your speed to the speed of the traffic around you so as not to slow down traffic behind you (road hogging). Even when
you are driving on the left hand side of the roadway, do not drive slowly at below 15km/h of the stipulated speed limits of the
road.
(b) It is courteous to give the right-of-way to others when circumstances permit.
(c) When right-of-way is given to you, it is gracious to show a ‘thank you’ hand gesture.
(d) When driving in countries with left-hand drive vehicles, do familiarise yourself with the traffic rules and regulations by
reading up on the Highway Code of that country. New drivers are to gradually familiarise themselves with the road conditions
in countries with Left Hand Drive if they plan to drive in those countries.
157 SIGNALLING
(a) Give appropriate signals early to allow others to act on them in time.
(b) Cancel your signals when they are not in use so as not to confuse others.
158 USE OF HORN
(a) Sound the horn only to warn other road users of dangers such as a likely collision.
(b) Do not use the horn to express anger or frustration.
(c) Do not use the horn to demand the right-of-way or bull doze your way through crowded places.
(d) Sounding your horn when driving is unnecessary, except as a warning. In some areas e.g. near a school or hospital, it is an
offence to use the horn, except to avoid an accident.
159 LANE DISCIPLINE
(a) Keep to the left of the road and leave the other lanes for other faster moving vehicles to pass safely.
(b) Keep within your lane. It is inconsiderate to straddle lanes as this would obstruct other vehicles and may lead to traffic being
held up.
(c) Do not weave in and out of traffic lanes as it would cause confusion and danger to others.
(d) Cutting into the path of other vehicles is discourteous/inconsiderate and likely to cause an accident and road rage.
160 AT ROAD JUNCTIONS
(a) Move into the correct lane early at road junctions to let others know your intended direction of travel.
(b) When making right turns, position your vehicle properly so that it does not hinder oncoming vehicles.
161 IN TRAFFIC QUEUES
(a) Stay in queue during traffic hold-ups. Do not jump queue. Jumping queue is discourteous/inconsiderate and would aggravate
the traffic jam.
(b) Leave a gap at the junction to a side road to enable vehicles from the opposite direction to turn right as well as for vehicles
from the side road to move out.
162 OVERTAKING
(a) Overtake only when it is absolutely necessary.
(b) Overtake only when you are sure that there are no other vehicles attempting to pass or overtake you.
(c) Slow down and keep left when being overtaken to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass quickly.
(d) Accelerating when others are trying to overtake you is unsafe and discourteous.
(e) Cutting into the path of another vehicle after overtaking it is discourteous and likely to anger the driver and cause an accident.

General Safe Driving /
Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

163 FOLLOWING DISTANCE
(a) Keep a safe following distance from the vehicle in front so as to allow yourself enough room to stop safely should the vehicle
in front stop abruptly.
(b) Do not harass the vehicle in front by tailgating it. This is a dangerous practice which could easily lead to an accident.
(c) Flashing your headlights or blasting the horn at slower moving vehicles in front of you is rude.
164 STOPPING AND PARKING
(a) Always stop or park close to the edge of the road.
(b) Always stop or park at places where you would not cause any inconvenience to other road users.
(c) Do not stop your vehicle under a shaded spot which is at a distance from a junction while waiting for the traffic signal to
change. This is a selfish act and slows down traffic at the junction.
(d) When parking your vehicle in a parking lot, be considerate by parking your vehicle parallel to and in the centre of the lot.
(e) Wait for your turn when looking for a parking lot. It is rude to jump queue or force your way into a lot when another vehicle
is trying to get into the parking lot.
165 LIGHTS
(a) Do not drive if your vehicle’s headlamps, tail-lamps and/or direction indicators are not working.
(b) Dip your headlights when following other vehicles or when facing oncoming vehicles, so as to prevent dazzling the drivers
of other vehicles.
(c) In the daytime when visibility is poor, you should turn on the headlights so that you can see and be seen more easily.
166 PEDESTRIANS (ESPECIALLY THE YOUNG AND ELDERLY), CYCLISTS AND MOTORCYCLISTS
(a) Give pedestrians (especially the young and elderly), cyclists and motorcyclists plenty of room from your vehicle as they might
change direction suddenly.
(b) Do not sound the horn when you are close to pedestrians as you might scare and cause them to react irrationally, resulting in
an accident.
(c) Do not obstruct pedestrians by stopping on the pedestrian crossing.
(d) On wet roads, slow down when you are near pedestrians and cyclists so as not to splash them with water from the road.
(e) It is not safe to pass a cyclist, be patient and wait until it is safe. This should not hold you up for long and it may save the
cyclist’s life.
(f) If a cyclist is ahead of you and you want to turn, turn behind the cyclist. Overtaking and cutting off the cyclist is very
dangerous. If and when you do need to overtake cyclists, always ensure that there is ample room from your vehicle when
overtaking (this is especially so for drivers of heavy or large vehicles), and do not merge sharply into lanes.
(g) Always check your blind spot before changing lanes, making turns or moving from a stationary position.
(h) Always check for cyclists before opening the vehicle door.
(i) Signal early to inform other road users and cyclists of the direction in which you are heading.
(j) When approaching road crossings, look out for cyclists and pedestrians.
(k) Always stop to render assistance and exchange particulars when involved in an accident.
(l) Do not expect cyclists to cycle all the way to the left next to the kerb, because their pedals may hit the kerb and there are
usually drain holes at the side where their tyres could get stuck in and cyclist could lose balance.
167 PATIENCE
(a) Always be patient. Do not rush or lose your cool on the road.
(b) It is not gracious to show any provocative gesture when other drivers do something wrong or cause inconvenience to you. No
one would deliberately get himself/herself involved in an accident.
168 TO ERR IS HUMAN; APOLOGISE AND FORGIVE
Indicate that you are sorry when you have caused inconvenience to others. This will soothe the other driver.

SAFE DRIVING TECHNIQUE (DEFENSIVE DRIVING TECHNIQUE)
169 Safe/Defensive driving technique:
Driving safely and competently demands the total involvement of most of your senses. It is not enough to gain physical mastery
of the vehicle without cultivating an awareness of the environment. A good driver can interpret, anticipate and act unhesitatingly
under adverse driving conditions.
170 Adverse conditions include:
(a) Driver conditions
(b) Weather conditions
(c) Light conditions
(d) Road conditions
(e) Traffic conditions

171 DRIVER CONDITIONS
Your physical and mental condition can affect your driving. These conditions are:
(a) Your vision,
(b) Your physical health,
(c) Your mental state,
(d) Consumption of alcohol and drugs.
172 Eighty percent (80%) of information perceived while driving comes through the driver’s eyes. It is therefore important that you
make optimal use of your eyes when driving. Do not fix your eyes on a particular object for longer than necessary. Keep moving
your eyes about every two seconds or so. Also, take regular glances at the rear view mirrors every five to ten seconds so that you
are aware of the changing situation around you. As the vehicle speed increases, your field of vision would be reduced.
173 Tiredness, giddiness and being unwell can affect your concentration on the road. If you feel unwell or tired, do not drive.
174 Anger, worry and stress can also reduce concentration and may lead to rash or careless driving on the road.
175 Consumption of alcohol and certain types of drugs affect your judgement, concentration and reaction time. If you are on
medication, check with your doctor whether the prescribed medicine you are taking will affect your driving ability. If so, do not
drive. It is also unsafe for you to drive if you have consumed alcohol.
176 It is an offence for a person to drive or attempt to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. If a driver is suspected to
be under the influence of alcohol, he/she will be required to undergo a breath analyser test. A person with a BAC (Blood Alcohol
Concentration) exceeding 80mg per 100ml of blood is presumed incapable of controlling his/her vehicle properly.
177 WEATHER CONDITIONS
Adverse weather conditions affect your ability to see and be seen.
These conditions are:-

RAIN

FLOOD

STRONG WINDS

178 The basic rules to follow when driving in bad weather conditions are:
(a) Reduce your speed so that you can manoeuvre safely.
(b) Do not out-drive the actual distance that you can see clearly.
(c) Switch on your headlights so that you can see more clearly and be more visible.
(d) Turn on the demister to clear the mist on the windscreen.
(e) Move to a safe spot and stop at the side of the road with your hazard lights turned on if you cannot see clearly. Proceed when
conditions are favourable.
(f) Use a faster front windscreen wiper speed when driving in heavy rain.
179 On a wet road, the stopping distance of a vehicle will increase to about twice the distance of that on a dry road. This is because
there is less friction between the tyres and the wet road surface. On a wet road, stepping hard on the brake pedal (locking the
wheels) will cause the vehicle to skid or spin. If you lock the wheels accidentally, quickly release the brake pedal and apply the
intermittent (ON/OFF) braking technique until the vehicle comes to a stop. Thus, on a wet road, it is important that you drive at
a slower speed to avoid such dangerous circumstances.

BASIC THEORY OF DRIVING

65

PART B
CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

180 On a rainy day, a thin layer of water forms on the road surface. Even good
tyres may not have a good grip on the road. As speed increases, surface water
builds up under the vehicle’s tyres. When this happens, your vehicle will
glide on the surface of the road, and this is known as ‘Aquaplaning’.
181 Aquaplaning results in the loss of steering control and braking efficiency.
The faster you go, the more difficult it will be to control the vehicle. To
counter this, you should slow down by braking intermittently (on/off
braking) until you gain control of your vehicle.

182 When approaching a road that is flooded but passable to vehicles, engage a
lower gear to go through the flood

183 After passing through water, the brakes become ineffective. To dry the
brakes, pump the brake pedal repeatedly until braking action returns.

184 You can also dry the brakes by gently depressing the brake pedal with your
left foot while pressing the accelerator with the right foot.

185 At night, the depth of flood water can be deceptive. If in doubt, take an alternative route.
186 Stretches of open highways are usually subjected to strong winds. To avoid the danger of being forced into the path of other traffic
by the wind, you should slow down and drive cautiously.
187 LIGHT CONDITIONS
Too much or too little light will affect our ability to see. Sun-glare or light reflected off objects or a pool of water on the road
can dazzle and even blind our vision. You should wear sunglasses or lower the sun-visor when it is very bright.

188 Switch on your headlights from 7pm to 7am. Drive at a slower speed than you would during the day.

BASIC THEORY OF DRIVING

66

PART B
CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Safe Driving Technique (Defensive Driving Technique)

189 When the headlight of an oncoming vehicle dazzles you, look to your left to
avoid the glare. Use the edge of the road to guide your vehicle. If the light is
blinding, slow down and stop by the side of the road.

190 When facing oncoming traffic, dip your headlights.

191 Dip your headlight when you are immediately behind another vehicle. If not, the beam from your headlight will be reflected by
the rear view mirror of the car in front and dazzle the driver.

192 On approaching bends where visibility is poor, use your high beam. This will attract the attention of other road users and warn
them of your approach.

193 It is safer not to out-drive your normal headlight range. The average headlight on high beam is about 100 metres.

194 ROAD CONDITIONS
A good driver should know how to read and adjust his/her speed accordingly to suit the road conditions, such as:
(a) The width of the road;
(b) The kind of road surface he/she is driving on;
(c) The contour of the road;
(d) The possible danger of hazards ahead.

195 On a sandy or pebbled surface, there is a greater risk of ‘side slipping’. Try
to avoid hard acceleration, braking and sudden sharp turning of the steering
wheel.

196 If the rear of your vehicle skids side way, remove the foot from the
accelerator at once. Never apply the brakes during a skid correction, steer in
the direction of the skid.

(a) On roads with uneven surfaces, drive slowly.

(b) If you encounter large pot-holes, reduce your
speed further and proceed slowly.

197 When driving round a bend or sharp corner at high speed, your vehicle tends to be pushed out of its path of travel by a force called
the Centrifugal Force.

198 The greater the travelling speed around the curve or the sharper the curve,
the more the vehicle will be pushed from its path. You should therefore
reduce speed when going round a bend. The diagram on the right shows the
appropriate speed and the dangerous speed for each turning radius.

199 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
Traffic conditions vary depending on time, place and situation. Traffic may be congested or relatively light. The speed of other
vehicles also varies. Try to drive with the traffic in order not to disrupt its flow.
200 Adjust your speed to the traffic and road situation. Situations change as you travel from urban built-up areas to sub-urban and
then to rural areas.

URBAN

SUB-URBAN

RURAL

201 In urban areas, traffic is slow and heavy. Traffic is faster and lighter in suburban areas. In rural areas, traffic is generally light.
Whatever the traffic conditions, the driver has the responsibility to be careful and alert at all times.
202 DRIVING OVERSEAS
Most countries in Europe adopt a left hand drive system, ie. you’ll find the steering wheel on the other side of the car.
For more information on overseas driving tips, please refer to the Automobile Association of Singapore’s website. Being prepared
will allow you to drive more confidently.

CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE ROAD

Roadworthiness

ROADWORTHINESS
204 Maintain your vehicle in a roadworthy condition. You should pay attention to the following matters in regard to
maintenance, which if attended to, could prevent accidents.
(a) Tyres
Keep your tyres up to the correct pressure. Tyres that have treads less than 1.6mm in depth should be replaced. Smooth or
bald tyres will cause skids when you brake hard in an emergency, whether the road is wet or dry.
(b) Brakes
Have the brake system checked regularly, particularly hydraulic brakes, for any leakage of brake fluid may indicate that a
serious fault is developing.
(c) Steering
The steering assembly of your car should be regularly checked and kept in good condition. Check for vibration or too much
looseness in the steering mechanism or wheels that are out of alignment. A car that wanders on the road because of faulty
steering is as dangerous as a car being driven by a drunk driver.
(d) Lights
Check all your vehicle lights regularly.
(e) Direction Indicators
Keep your signalling devices in order by checking them frequently. Signal lights that do not light up when required may cause
an accident.
(f) Horn
Check your horn to make sure it is in working order.
(g) Radiator Coolant
Check the level of coolant in the radiator regularly. Most modern cars come with a coolant reservoir and the correct coolant
level should be somewhere between the ‘high’ and ‘low’ indicator markings. Checking should be done when the engine is
cool especially for cars without coolant reservoirs. Coolant in the radiator is highly pressurised when hot and releasing the
radiator cap may drench you with boiling liquid. Ensure that the engine is cool before opening the radiator cap.
(h) Engine Oil
Keep enough oil in the engine and have the oil changed periodically. Check the oil level with the help of the dip-stick.
(i) Windscreen Wipers
Make sure that your windscreen wipers are kept in good condition. Dirty windscreens and faulty wipers will hinder vision
when it rains.
(j) Battery
Keep the battery and its terminals clean. Make sure that the connections at the terminals are securely tightened. Check the
level of the battery water if your battery is not the maintenance-free type. If the water level is below the ‘low’ level, add
distilled or commercially available battery water. Refilling with tap water will shorten battery life considerably.
(k) Exhaust
All vehicles must be maintained in a condition and be driven in a manner so as to eliminate excessive emission of smoke and
noise. Smoke and noise are a nuisance and hazardous to health. Check the exhaust system regularly. If exhaust fumes leak
into the passenger compartment, especially if the car is idling with its air-conditioner on, it can be dangerous as there is a
likelihood of carbon-monoxide poisoning.

SCHOOL ZONE SAFETY
213 Children are vulnerable road users with limited experience using the roads, thus it is of paramount importance to keep school
zones safe.

ROAD SAFETY MEASURES
214 Several road engineering measures have been installed in school zones to enhance safety. These include:
(a) Prominent school zone signs that remind motorists to drive carefully
(b) Traffic calming measures such as road humps
(c) Pedestrian crossings
(d) Parking restriction lines
(e) Railings along the road centre to deter jaywalking
(f) Parts of the road surface near the school gate are covered with a red texture to catch drivers’ attention and alert them to drive
carefully and to look out for children crossing the road.

DRIVING IN SCHOOL ZONES
215 (a) Slow down and drive very carefully when you are in a school zone.
(b) Be extra vigilant in watching out for children crossing the road as they may be easily blocked from your view due to their
height.
(c) Be patient when you encounter heavy traffic at school zones during school peak hours. If you are rushing for time, please take
other routes if you can.
(d) If you drive your child to school, let him/her alight at safe and proper drop-off points.

SILVER ZONE SAFETY
216 Silver zones are designated areas with enhanced road safety engineering measures such as new signs, road features and markings
to change the character of the street, making it safe and more convenient for senior pedestrians to cross the road.
217 Silver zones are found in selected housing estates with high senior populations, relatively higher accident rates involving senior
and proximity to places where seniors frequent.

ROAD SAFETY MEASURES
218 Several road safety engineering measures have been installed in silver zones to enhance road safety for all road users, senior
pedestrians in particular. These includes:
(a) Silver zone gateway treatment which includes signs and road markings to indicate the start of a silver zone.

(b) Setback crossings to provide reduced crossing distance for pedestrians.
(c) 2-stage crossings so that pedestrians can rest momentarily at the pedestrian refuge (centre divider) before continuing to cross
the road
(d) Centre divider to narrow lanes and reduce vehicles’ travel speeds.
(e) Traffic calming measures such as chicanes and eye-lands (horizontal curves constructed along existing straight stretches of
roads), pinch points (narrowed lanes to slow motorists down) and bus-friendly humps.
(f) Silver zone bollards at crossings to highlight the crossing points.

DRIVING IN SILVER ZONES
219 (a) Drive slow and carefully within silver zones, especially when approaching crossings.
(b) Be extra vigilant in watching out for all pedestrians, especially senior pedestrians crossing the road.

AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE (AV)
INTRODUCTION
224 An AV is a vehicle that can drive from a starting location to a pre-determined destination using various technologies and sensors
to sense its environment and navigate in autonomous mode.
225 As part of the long-term vision of deploying autonomous vehicles and shared-mobility concepts to complement our multi-modal
land transport system in Singapore, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) started facilitating AV trials in July 2015 at one-north.
The AV test-bed area was recently expanded to neighbouring areas such as the National University of Singapore, Singapore
Science Park 1 and 2, Dover and Buona Vista. For public notification, signboards are put up in the test areas to indicate that trials
are being carried out.

HOW TO RECOGNISE AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON TRIAL?
226 AVs that are approved by LTA for the purpose of trials on public roads are issued with permits and sport decals for easy
recognition by road users.

HOW TO INTERACT WITH AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE ON TRIAL
227 A good driver is not merely one who is skilful in handling his/her vehicle competently but more importantly is one who is safe.
In addition, a good driver must also be patient, considerate and courteous. He must have a sense of responsibility for the safety of
other road users and the ability to concentrate, anticipate and react appropriately while driving.
228 Safe driving calls for total awareness of what other road users are doing. The correct attitude towards driving will make the road
a safer and more pleasant place.
229 When you notice an AV being tested on the road, you should continue driving safely as you would normally do. You are advised
to observe these simple driving practices:
(a) Do not tailgate
(i) Tailgating, or following too closely behind another vehicle is a dangerous practice. If the front vehicle stops suddenly,
an accident is inevitable since you will not be able to stop in time.
(b) Maintain a safe following distance
(i) Drive at a steady speed and avoid unnecessary acceleration or braking.
(ii) Maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and the AV so that you will have more time to react if necessary.
(c) Overtake only if necessary
(i) Never overtake unless you can do so without endangering yourself or others. Similar to overtaking any other vehicles,
you need to check that it is safe to do so and leave a safe gap between your vehicle and the AV when overtaking.
(ii) After overtaking, return to the appropriate lane on the road as soon as it is safe to do so, but do not cut in sharply in front
of the vehicle you have just overtaken.

ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE (EM)
INTRODUCTION
230 Electric powered motorcycles and scooters are plug-in-electric vehicles with two or three wheels. The electricity is stored on
board in a rechargeable battery, which drives one or more electric motors.
231 Electric powered motorcycles and scooters are generally of the same size and weight and are comparable in performance with
petrol driven motorcycles.

FEATURES OF ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLES
232 The features of the electric motorcycles are similar to the petrol engine motorcycles. They generally have the same operating
function such as brakes, mirrors, lights and etc.
233 The only difference is that electric motorcycle runs on automatic transmission gear without having the clutch which is used for
manual transmission motorcycles. Similarly, some petrol engine motorcycles and scooters presently runs on automatic
transmission.
234 Electric motorcycles have better acceleration as they develop higher torque. Generally electric motorcycles weigh lighter and
have a low engine noise.

LANE USE AND VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS (LUS) / EMERGENCY FACILITIES (TUNNELS)
LANE USE AND VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS (LUS)
240 Lane Use Signs are overhead signs in the KPE, CTE, MCE, Woodsville and Fort Canning
tunnels which are used to inform motorists of any precautions to take prior to proceeding
ahead on the lane. Each lane use sign will display either a green-down arrow, flashing
amber cross or a red cross. A green-down arrow indicates that a motorist can drive on
ahead; a flashing amber cross indicates that a motorist needs to drive with caution (e.g.
obstructions on the lane ahead); and a red cross indicates that a motorist shall not proceed
beyond the sign. Motorists travelling in the tunnel are to adhere to the displays shown on
these overhead lane use signs.
241 The Variable Message Signs on the road are used to disseminate traffic condition information to motorists.
There are various types of Variable Message Signs along the tunnels and at arterial roads leading to tunnels:
(a) Entrance Variable Message Signs (EVMS): Located at the entrance of the slip
road leading into the tunnel.

(b) Arterial Variable Message Signs (AVMS): Located along an arterial road that
leads to the entrance to the tunnel.

(c) Tunnel Variable Message Signs (TVMS): An overhead sign located in the tunnel.
242 For closure of the KPE, MCE and Woodsville tunnel, barriers and traffic signal controls at entry slip road approaches will be
activated.
243 Variable speed limit signs are also provided in the KPE and MCE tunnels. In smooth traffic
conditions, the display on the signs will show a posted speed limit (with a red ring) that requires
motorists’ compliance. At times of congestion, recommended lower speed limits can be
displayed (without a red ring) to smoothen out the flow, reduce the risk of flow breakdown and
minimise the risk of accidents.
244 KM markings are found on the vertical face of the kerb wall in the MCE, KPE and CTE tunnels
to provide location referencing for the motorists

EMERGENCY FACILITIES
Exit
245 Exit doors are located next to both the slow and fast lanes of the MCE, KPE and CTE tunnels.
246 Escape Staircase doors - These exit doors next to the slow lanes can generally be found at intervals of
500m in the main tunnel. There are also exit doors along the slip roads. These exit doors lead to escape
staircases which open up to surface roads or open areas.

247 Cross-passage doors - These exit doors next to the fast lanes are located at intervals of
100m in the main tunnel and they lead to the opposite-bound tunnel.
248 During an emergency, additional flashing lights at the doors will be lighted up to alert
motorists of the emergency situation and the need for evacuation, and to draw their
attention to the exit locations.

CTE Escape
Staircase Doors

CTE Cross
Passage Doors

Communication (OCC - Operations Control Centre)
249 Emergency telephones are provided in the tunnel next to the slow lane at approximately
100m intervals.
250 Each phone also has an amber light next to it that can be switched on to indicate to the
motorist the OCC’s intention to communicate with him/her in the MCE and KPE
tunnel. The motorist can pick up the phone set to speak to the OCC.

PART C
EMERGENCY/INCIDENT PROCEDURES (TUNNELS)
251 Radio break-in is an important tool for the OCC to communicate with motorists in the tunnel during an emergency and as a good
driving habit, motorists are encouraged to tune into an FM radio channel before entering the tunnel.
Fire Protection
252 Portable fire extinguishers are also provided in the emergency cabinet which is available at
50m intervals along the tunnel. Motorists can make use of the fire extinguishers to put out
any small scale fire in their vehicles.
253 MCE and Woodsville tunnels are equipped with a water-based firefighting system. This is an
overhead water sprinkler system that helps suppress fire growth rates to further protect major
structural tunnel elements and minimise the potential impact of a fire.
254 Coupled with the ventilation system present in all our road tunnels, the water-based
firefighting system enhances the overall incident management process in the event of fire

EMERGENCY/INCIDENT PROCEDURES
255 For Motorist Whose Vehicle Is Broken Down
(a) Switch on vehicle hazard lights.
(b) When possible, drive onto the road shoulder and stop the vehicle.
(c) The motorist can use the nearest emergency (SOS) phone (located next to the slow lane of tunnel) to contact the OCC for
assistance. Alternatively, the motorist can dial 1800-CALL LTA (1800-2255582) for assistance.
(d) LTA EMAS vehicle recovery service crew will arrive at the incident site to tow the stalled vehicle to the nearest designated
car park.
256 For Motorist Who Meets With An Accident
(a) If there is neither injury nor serious damage caused to the accident vehicles, motorists involved in the accident are advised to
drive out of the tunnel (especially for accidents which occur in the tunnel) and discuss all details pertaining to the accident at
a safe location e.g. public car park.
(b) If there is injury, or if an accident vehicle cannot be moved, motorists can use the nearest emergency (SOS) phone (if the
accident occurs in the tunnel) to contact the OCC for assistance. Alternatively, motorists can dial 1800-CALL LTA (18002255582) or 995/ 999 for assistance.
(c) LTA EMAS and SCDF/Traffic Police response teams will arrive at the incident site to assist the motorists.
257 For Motorist Whose Vehicle Is On Fire
(a) Use the manual call point to sound an alarm and wait for help.
(b) Use the portable fire extinguisher inside the emergency cabinet to attempt to extinguish the smoke if the situation appears
manageable.
(c) Dial 1800-CALL LTA (1800-2255582) or use the nearest emergency (SOS) phone to contact the OCC for assistance.
Alternatively, the motorist could contact the OCC immediately.
(d) LTA and SCDF/Traffic Police response teams will arrive at the incident site to assist the motorist.
258 For Motorist Who Encounters A Tunnel Emergency Eg. Fire in Tunnel
If you are in the tunnel:
(a) Listen to any of the local radio channels for LTA emergency announcements and instructions.
(b) Look out for the lane use signs.
(c) If you cannot proceed, do not attempt to reverse your vehicle; turn off your engine and leave your vehicle. Proceed to the

ECO-DRIVING: WAYS TO SAVE FUEL AND SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT
INTRODUCTION
261 How you drive and treat your vehicle can have a significant impact on fuel consumption and emissions. Practicing eco-driving
can reduce fuel consumption by up to 10% on average over time1. By observing just a few simple eco-driving steps, you can
reduce fuel use and at the same time reduce vehicular emissions. This lets you play a part in saving the environment while
saving money!

What is Eco-Driving?
262 Eco-driving generally refers to the practice of handling one’s vehicle in a manner that promotes fuel economy and reduces
emissions. These include vehicle maintenance, on-road driver behaviour, and route selection.

How to ADOPT Eco-DRIVING
263 Eco-driving is not difficult. You can lower your vehicle’s fuel consumption and impact on the environment by observing these
simple driving practices:
(a) Don’t Leave Your Vehicle Engine idling
(i)
Turn off the engine when your vehicle is stationary for reasons other than traffic conditions. Idling engines waste fuel,
generate unnecessary pollution to the environment, and cause fumes and noise nuisance to the public.
Note: Under the Environmental Protection and Management
(Vehicular Emissions) Regulations, it is an offence to leave the
vehicle engine running when it is stationary for reasons other than
traffic conditions. Offenders are liable to a fine of up to $5,000, if
convicted in court.

Do not idle your vehicle’s engine
(ii)

There is no need to warm up the engine before driving off. Modern engines reach their optimal temperature faster when
the vehicle is driven at moderate speeds upon starting.

Turn off the engine when your vehicle is stationary
(b) Maintain Your Vehicle Regularly
(i)
Service your vehicle regularly. A well maintained vehicle is more fuel efficient and emits less pollution on the road.
(ii)
Check your vehicle’s tyre pressure at least once a month. Correctly inflated tyres help reduce drag, improve fuel
economy and reduce pollution. So make sure your tyres are at their recommended pressure.
(iii)
Avoid over-loading your vehicle. Carrying excess weight in a vehicle increases fuel consumption and emissions. Heavy
or large items, e.g. heavy tool kits, etc., should be removed from your vehicle when not required.

Ensure that your vehicle’s tyres are correctly inflated

Carry only what is necessary; avoid unnecessary weight

ECO-DRIVING: WAYS TO SAVE FUEL AND SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT
(c) Drive Smoothly
(i)
Avoid dragging the engine by using the correct gear if you drive a manual vehicle. Driving the vehicle in the right gear
will increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.
(ii)
Drive at a steady speed and avoid unnecessary acceleration or braking as much as possible. Avoiding unnecessary
acceleration Maintain a and heavy braking helps reduce your vehicle’s fuel consumption.
(iii)
safe distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front to avoid last-minute braking and to get up to speed as
smoothly as possible.

Drive at a safe and steady speed
(d) Minimise Use of the Air-Conditioner While Driving
(i)
Avoid setting your vehicle’s air-conditioning temperature too low and instead increase the fan speed in order to achieve
higher fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Air-conditioning consumes a lot of fuel to keep you cool!

Avoid setting your air-conditioning temperature too low
(e) Plan Your Journey
(i)
Plan your journey before setting off to avoid traffic congestion or getting lost on the roads. This can save you both time
and fuel as well as reduce emissions.

Plan your journey

SECURITY MEASURES TO PREVENT THEFT OF/FROM MOTOR VEHICLES
INTRODUCTION
264 Motor vehicle theft (MVT) and theft from vehicle (TFV) are two of the Police’s key crime concerns. The majority of these cases
take place in carparks located in public housing estates.
265 Similar to past trends, theft of motorcycles continue to form the majority (about two-thirds) of all theft of motor-vehicles reported
to the police. Joyrides and transportation for personal uses continue to be common motives for stealing such vehicles. However,
some stolen vehicles are never recovered.
266 Likewise, for theft from vehicles, common items stolen, especially from cars, are laptops, handbags, cash cards and handphones.
The culprit(s) usually smash the window or windscreen of the car in the dead of the night to gain access to the valuables left
behind by the owner.
267 Therefore, it is every vehicle owner’s responsibility to ensure the security of their vehicle and valuables kept within, in order to
prevent such thefts from occurring. Future vehicle owners such as yourself, are encouraged to enhance the security of vehicles by
taking adequate crime prevention measures.
268 The inconveniences and monetary loses caused to vehicle owners by such thefts are significant. You can prevent such unfortunate
incidents by adopting the following simple measures:

MOTORCYCLES
269 (a) Remove the ignition keys and handle lock your motorcycle, even if you are leaving for a short while. It takes only a short
time for thieves to strike;
(b) Locking devices such as front wheel safety lock, handlebar lock, brake/disc lock and cable lock can be used to enhance the
security of your motorcycle;
(c) Use a motorcycle canvas to cover the vehicle, securing both ends with locks;
(d) Consider fitting additional safety devices such as an alarm system and immobilizer for your motorcycle;
(e) To prevent the motorcycle parts from being stolen, you may consider labelling security markings (e.g. the vehicle registration
number) on major parts of the motorcycle or installing a device known as a suspension guard to prevent easy removal of the
motorcycle’s suspension;
(f) Remove your cashcard from the IU when you leave your motorcycle.

CARS
270 (a) Remove the ignition key, wind up all the windows and lock all the doors whenever it is left unattended, even for a short while;
(b) Do not leave valuables such as cash cards, briefcases, handbags, laptops or handphones exposed in your vehicle. If need be,
such items should be kept out of sight or locked in the car boot;
(c) Consider fitting additional safety devices such as an anti-theft alarm system or an immobilizer on your vehicle. An anti-theft
alarm should be regularly checked/serviced to ensure its effectiveness;
(d) Use an additional lock such as steering wheel lock, clutch & brake locks, gear lock, etc.;
(e) Keep a record of the serial numbers of valuable items such as laptops, handphones (IMEI no.) and/or cash cards. These will
help the police in investigations.

GENERAL
271 (a) Be wary of suspicious characters loitering around the carparks. If you see any person loitering around suspiciously, do not
hesitate to contact the Police at ‘999’;
(b) Whenever possible, park your vehicle in a well-lit area. Avoid parking at dark or secluded areas;
(c) Form a good habit of securing your vehicle. Always remember, “Lock, Look and Leave”:
(i) Lock your vehicle and ensure that all valuables are kept out of sight,
(ii) Look around your car when parking. Whenever
possible, park your vehicle in a well-lit area or prominent location where human traffic volume is high,
(iii) Leave your car secured and with peace of mind;
(d) Crime prevention is a shared responsibility. Crime can be prevented if owners and members of the public adopt measures to
stay vigilant against criminal acts. Together, we can help make Singapore a safer home for all.

PART C
KEY POINTS OF THE MOTOR CLAIMS FRAMEWORK (MCF)
272 In the case of an Accident, you should avoid all unauthorised tow-truck operators or repair workshops.
Steps to take:
273 (a) Exchange particulars of involved parties (including Name, NRIC/FIN, Telephone Number, Address and Insurer);
(b) Take note of the Vehicle Numbers;
(c) Take pictures at the accident scene and submit all pictures at your authorised accident reporting centre during reporting;
Things to Photograph:
(i) The Scene (Take pictures of the accident scene capturing the accident vehicles and surrounding areas);
(ii) Own Vehicle (Take pictures of the damage to your own vehicle, capturing your licence plate);
(iii) Other Damaged Vehicles (Take pictures of damage to all other vehicles involved in the accident, capturing their license
plates. For multiple vehicle collision, take pictures of the vehicles with direct contact, e.g. vehicles in the immediate
front and immediate rear.)
274 Call your insurer’s hotline for a tow truck or for further advice on the accident.
275 Report and bring your accident vehicle (whether damaged or not) to the approved reporting centre / authorised workshop within
24 hours or by the next working day.
The benefits of reporting:
276 By reporting the accident within the stipulated time, you not only enjoy hassle-free and quality-certified repair services as provided
under the MCF, you will also avoid potentially higher costs from exaggerated claims.
(a) Remember that all accidents must be reported to your insurer within 24 hours or by the next working day with your accident
vehicle. Report the accident no matter how trivial or even if there is no visible damage, and irrespective of whether you are
claiming from any insurers or third parties.
(b) Should you fail to report the accident to your insurer with your accident vehicle, you may find yourself in a position of
having your claims prejudiced or declined later by insurers. Failure to comply with this new policy condition will be seen as
being “In breach” of the policy terms and conditions, i.e. there will be no liability on the part of the insurer. In addition, any
non-compliance with this policy condition will result in a loss of your ‘No Claims Discount’ upon renewal of your policy.
