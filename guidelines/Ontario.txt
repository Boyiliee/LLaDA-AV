Graduated Licensing System

Before obtaining a full driver’s licence (G-licence) all new drivers are
required to complete the Graduated Licensing System. It is a two-step
process that will take a minimum 20 months. You have up to 5 years to
complete the system and it begins the day that you pass your knowledge
test. The Graduated Licensing System consists of one knowledge test
and two road tests. The program is designed to allow new drivers of all
ages to become familiar with the rules of the road.

Class G1:

Once you have passed the knowledge test you will be considered a Gl
driver. As a Gl driver, you must observe the following rules:

+ Be accompanied by a fully licensed driver, who has at least four
years of driving experience or a licensed driving instructor, both
of whom must has a blood alcohol level of less than .05 percent

- s+ * The accompanying driver must be the
only other person in the front seat

WRITTEN TEST

» The number of passengers in the
vehicle are limited to the number of
working seat belts

« You must have a zero blood alcohol
level while operating a vehicle

« Refrain from driving between
midnight to 5:00 a.m.

« Refrain from driving on Ontario’s
“400-series” highways or on
expressways such as the Queen
Elizabeth Way, Don Valley Parkway,
Gardiner Expressway, E. C. Row
Expressway and the Conestoga
Parkway. You may, however, drive

G LICENSE on any of these roads if you are

accompanied by an Ontario licensed

driving instructor

This stage lasts for a minimum of 12 months before a new driver can
take the G1 road test. It can be reduced to 8 months if you successfully
pass a Ministry approved drivers education course. You may also be
eligible for a reduction in insurance rates later on.

Class G2:

Once you have passed the G1 road test you will be considered to have
more experience and can drive on your own without an accompanying
driver on any Ontario road at anytime.

However, there are still a few limitations while you are driving;

* You must still maintain a zero blood alcohol level while driving

» Limit the number of passengers in the vehicle to the number of
working seat belts

New rules for teenage G2 drivers®, effective September 1, 2005. These
new rules apply between midnight to 5 a.m. if you are a teenage driver:

In the first six months after receiving your G2 licence, you are
not allowed to carry more than one passenger whom is aged 19
or under.

« After six months with your G2 licence and until you obtain
your full G-licence or turn 20, you are allowed to carry up to
three passengers aged 19 or under.

* Exemptions:

These restrictions do not apply if you are accompanied by a fully
licensed driver (with at least four years of driving experience) in
the front seat or if your young passengers are members of your
immediate family.

The Class G2 stage lasts for a minimum of 12 months before a new
driver can attempt the G2 road test.

If you are charged or convicted of breaking any of the conditions
outlined as a G1 or G2 driver, your licence will be suspended
for 30 days.

Once you pass the G2 road test, your licence is upgraded to a G-
licence (full licence).

What if | don’t finish the program in 5 years?

« If the student does not complete the G1 and G2 stage within
the five year time frame, he/she must start over again from the
beginning with the knowledge test.

Vision Test

Before taking your knowledge test, you will be required to take a vision
test. You will be asked to look into a machine and read out the numbers
that appear as well as the location of a flashing red light (left or right side).

Types of Questions

The knowledge test consists of 40 multiple choice questions: 20 questions
on traffic signs and 20 questions on general driving knowledge. In total,
you may not score more than four incorrect answers in each section in
order to pass the test.

| If you fail the knowledge test, you may re-write the test after three
working days. There is an additional fee of $10 for each test you write.

Using the Computerized System

» Read each multiple choice question carefully and choose the
best answer out of the four choices available. If you decide
that answer #4 is the best answer, press “4” and when you are
confident of your answer press “OK” to confirm. If the answer
you have entered is correct, it will continue to the next question,
otherwise it will let you know you have answered it incorrectly

« Example: If the best answer is 4... press “4” and then “OK”

* Now you know what is
involved, let's prepare
for your Driver's
Knowledge Test!

distance in the event the vehicle in front of you should suddenly stop.
The two-second rule can help you leave a cushion of space and avoid a
collision. Simply select a fixed object on the road ahead of you such as
a sign or tree. When the vehicle ahead of you passes that object start
counting for two-seconds (i.e. one-thousand-and-one, one-thousand-
and-two). If you reached the object before you finished counting you
are following too closely. Slow down and begin counting again. If

8. Defensive Driving

A good driver is a defensive driver. You must realize that accidents
may occur where it is not your fault. Being prepared and thinking
ahead will help you avoid accidents and the mistakes of other drivers.
Here are a few things you can do to be a defensive driver:

If
2.

Obey speed limits and signs

Do not overtake another vehicle beside you if you are within 30

metres of a crosswalk (as the vehicle may block your vision of
pedestrians crossing)

Adjust your driving appropriately based on weather and road
conditions

Wear your seat belt

Use your horn when necessary and
make eye contact with pedestrians
and other drivers

Use the two-second rule and keep
a safe distance especially from
large vehicles and trucks

Watch the vehicle that is two cars
ahead of you

Always think ahead and plan escape
routes that you can go and keep
the two lanes beside you empty,
just in case a vehicle suddenly stops or cuts you off

If an accident is evident try to avoid head on collisions and steer
to the safest area possible

. Always check traffic in all directions before entering an intersection
. Always be alert and avoid driving when you are tired

. Avoid driving in the blind spots of other vehicles (especially buses

and trucks)

. Be prepared in the event a parked car opens their door when

driving in the city

. Pull over if you have to talk on your cell phone, eat or look at a

map while driving
Avoid road rage

Be courteous to other drivers and allow others to pass by slowing
down and moving to the right lane

9. Traffic Lights

i
§

Green Light—you may proceed straight,
make left turns (watching for cars coming

crossing the light that have the right of way)
or right turns (being cautious of pedestrians
and cyclists). Avoid blocking the intersection
during times of heavy traffic

Flashing Green Light—you have the right
of way to go straight, make a left or right
turn. All other traffic including pedestrians
will be facing a red light

Yellow or Amber Light—warns that the
traffic signal is about to turn red. If it
is safe for you to stop then you should,
otherwise proceed through the intersection
with caution

Single Flashing Yellow Light—you have
right of way but you should proceed with
caution checking the right and left hand
sides of the intersection as well as your rear
view mirror

Red Light with Green Arrow—if you are
turning in the same direction as the arrow

you have right of way, all other traffic may
not proceed

Red Light—You cannot go through the
intersection and should come to a complete
stop behind the white line or crosswalk. In
Ontario, you may make a right turn (unless
otherwise specified) if the light is red; however,
you must first make a complete stop and yield
to any vehicles or pedestrians crossing the
roadway. (On a one-way to one-way street you
may make a left turn after making a complete
stop and it is safe to do so)

Single Flashing Red Light—Make a complete
stop (treat as a stop sign) and when if it is safe,
you may proceed

Flashing Red Light—The street light is out of

order and you should come to a complete stop
and treat the intersection as a stop sign or

10. Day and Night Time Driving

« In sunny weather it is best to protect your eyes by wearing
sunglasses while driving and avoid looking directly at the sun.
You should also use your vehicle's sun visor to block the sun

« Ifentering a dark tunnel or underground parking garage slow
down to allow your eyes to adjust to the changing brightness levels

» Ensure your windshield is clean at all times to reduce glare and
increase visibility

« Since visibility is reduced by 25% at night time, the chances of
accidents occurring are higher. You should reduce your speed
and exercise caution

« If oncoming vehicles have their high beams on, avoid
looking straight at the lights by looking to the right hand
side of the roadway

« Always use your headlights during times of heavy fog, rain
and snow or half an hour before sunset and half an hour after
sunrise. You should also use your headlights when you cannot

Business Area Driving

nT
%
i
oy

Business area driving may differ from regular roads as there are more
entrances, pedestrians and parked cars. Keeping your eyes moving
and observing the traffic around you is the key. Keep an eye out for
entrances, as cars may suddenly turn in or turn out of them. Be careful
of parked cars on the side of the road as they may suddenly open their
doors to exit. Maintain the proper speed limits and check your rear
view mirror every five to ten seconds. Check traffic in all directions
before going into an intersection and avoid blocking the intersection
when the street in front of you is blocked with traffic.

Residential Area Driving

4

f- [BEG

You should be extra careful when driving in residential areas as there
are schools, kids playing and pedestrian crossings. Your eyes should
scan from side to side checking entrances to schools and homes. Do not
exceed the speed limit, check your mirrors every five to ten seconds and
be alert at all times. If there are no lane markings, keep to the centre of
the travelled part of the road, away from parked vehicles or pedestrians.

12. How to Make Left and Right Turns

Making a Left Turn

1.

Before approaching the intersection
keep to the left (making sure you
check your mirrors, blind spot and
use your left turn signal)

Slow down when you are entering
the left turn lane

Check to see that it is legal and safe
to make a left turn

Observe all points of the intersection including the left, centre
and right for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists

If it is a red light, stop behind the white line. If the light is green,
proceed 1/3 of the roadway (keeping your steering wheel straight)
and wait until the way is clear

Check your blind spot and proceed to make the left turn into the
left hand lane

Adjust your steering wheel to drive straight and then keep to the
right lane when it is safe to do so

15. Parallel Parking

Parallel parking is considered to be
one of the most challenging skills to
learn for a new driver. You will need to
parallel park in downtown areas where
parking is relatively scarce. Parallel
parking means that you will be parallel
with the curb and your front bumper
will be facing the back bumper of the
car in front of you in a line.

Once you find a spot to park in,
follow the steps below:

I. Observe the traffic around you,
signal right and slow down as you
approach the spot

2. Stop beside the vehicle in front
of the parking spot and allow
approximately 2 feet between your

vehicle & Car A. Your rear bumper
and Car A's rear bumper should be lined up

Put your vehicle in reverse gear. Using your mirrors, turn your
head to check your left blind spot and the areas around your
vehicle. Once the way is clear, turn your steering wheel all the

way towards the right. Slowly reverse, while turning your head to
see behind you

Stop your vehicle when your car is in a 45 degree angle to the
parking spot. Continue backing up slowly while gradually turning
your steering wheel all the way to the left. Once your vehicle is in

the spot, move forward to allow for the vehicles around you to get
out or until you are in the middle of the spot

Put your vehicle in park and set the parking brake

* Important to remember:

Your vehicle should not be more than 1 foot away from the curb
and your tires should not touch the curb

When pulling out of the spot, remember to signal, check your
blind spots and only pull out when it is safe to do so

Remember— Practice! Practice! Practice!

16. One-Way Streets

fa The flow of trafficis in only one direction
ey on a one-way street. Here are a few
Ls _— ways to tell if a street is a one-way:
+ There is no yellow line in the middle that divides the road

+ One-way signs are usually found at the beginning and at the
end of each intersection on both sides of the roadway

« Parked cars are all facing the same direction on both sides of
the roadway

+ The end of a one-way street will have a “Do Not Enter” sign

«+ Stop signs can be found on both sides of the roadway facing the
same direction

+ Street signs such as no stopping or speed limits are posted on
both sides of the roadway and are also facing the same direction

« If there are multiple lanes, vehicles may pass you on the left
hand side of the roadway

Entering and Exiting One-way Streets

1. From a two-way traffic to a one-way traffic (entering):

The reason why we turn our front wheels when parking on a hill,
is to prevent the car from rolling into traffic in the event the car’s
parking brakes fail. You must also remember to park as close to the
curb as possible, otherwise this technique will not work. Streetcars with passengers getting on
or off (and there is no safety island) —Stop at least 2 metres from

20. Expressway Driving (Entering and Exiting)

Large expressways link cities to each other and span from province to
province. There are at least two lanes going in the same direction on
an expressway. There are lanes for entering the expressway and other
lanes for exiting the expressway. Speed limits are usually between 80
- 100 km/h (unless otherwise posted). While driving on expressways
you should be extra careful and alert at all times just in case you need
to react quickly. Many accidents occur on the expressway during poor
weather conditions due to increased speeds. Since you should not
stop on the side of a highway or drive at unreasonably slow speeds, it
is a good idea to know where you are going and write your directions
down. Plan well ahead when exiting the expressway and never change

lanes abruptly to exit the expressway. Pedestrians and bicycles may
not enter an expressway.

Entering the Expressway:

CORRECT. _ . »

I. When entering an expressway, you should pay careful attention
to the ramp speed. Ensure you keep a safe distance from the
vehicles in front of you and reduce your speed further during
adverse weather conditions. Pay attention to the vehicles behind
and around you as well.

2. Once you reach the acceleration lane, signal to the left and begin
accelerating to a speed with the flow of traffic. Watch for vehicles
on the expressway by checking your mirrors and your blind spot.
When you have nearly reached the end of the acceleration lane
and the way is clear, switch lanes and cancel your signal. Avoid
switching lanes too early from the acceleration lane as drivers on
the expressway may need time to adjust their speeds to allow you
to enter their lane. Continue at the expressway’s stated speed limit.

il

Driving on the Expressway

I. Always keep both hands on the steering wheel. Look ahead to
where you are going to be in the next 15 to 20 seconds, or as far
ahead as you can see when you are traveling at a faster speed.

2. Constantly check the traffic and your rear view mirror every 5
~ 10 seconds. Allow 3 - 4 seconds between you and the vehicle in
front of you. When you change lanes, ensure you signal and check
your blind spot first. If you happen to be following a bus or truck,
avoid staying in their blind spots for prolonged periods of time

3. If there is more than one lane, stay to the right and use the far left
lane for passing only.

4. Be patient when weather conditions or visibility is poor or there
is traffic ahead of you. Reduce your speed and be courteous to
other drivers.

Exiting the Expressway

a CORRECT BIE TI )~ - 1

—
So

I. Check the traffic conditions around you and determine which
lanes are used for exiting the expressway. If you are exiting from
the right, keep to the right hand side of the expressway. Check
your rear view mirrors and signal to the right. Check your blind
spot and when the way is clear change into the exit lane.

2. You should enter the exit lane when it begins. Once your vehicle
is fully in the exit lane begin to reduce your speed. Avoid entering
the exit lane at the last moment.

3. Payattention to the ramp speed and reduce your speed accordingly.
Do not drive too closely to the vehicles in front of you. Look out
for yield signs or lane merges ahead.

4. Once you are back on local trafic watch for pedestrians and
posted speed limits.

271. Tips for your Road Test:

When you feel confident and you are
ready to take your road test examination,
book an appointment with your local
DriveTest Centre. On your examination
date, you must bring your own vehicle or
arrange to use your driving instructor’s
vehicle. Arrive at least 30 minutes before
your exam and bring your driver’s
licence. Let the office know which parking spot you have parked in and
proceed to wait in your vehicle.

An examiner will enter your vehicle and sit in the passenger seat. Your
examination will test your level of observation, driving skills and all
parking techniques. To help you pass your test, we have compiled a list

of items and tips you should know:

For the G1 road test:

|. Before starting your engine, make sure your seat belt is on. Your
examiner will give you instructions on where to go.

2. Itisagoodideato exaggerate your movements (like checking your
mirrors and blind spots) as you want to make sure your examiner
knows that you did check.

3. Many test centres are located in malls where you must keep an
eye out for pedestrians and parked cars. Maintain a speed limit
of 15 - 20 km/h.

4. Make sure you are following the posted speed limits and never
exceed the speed limit. Where no speed limit signs are posted
(residential areas) you should drive at a speed of 40 km/h, in
busier main streets (also not posted) the maximum is 50 km/h.

5. Always keep a safe distance to the car in front of you and keep
your eyes moving from left to centre to right. Also check your rear
view mirror every 5 — 10 seconds.

6. Slow down when you are approaching crosswalks and look from
side to side, checking to see if pedestrians are crossing.

7. When following a bus or truck, allow even more space between
your vehicle and the bus or truck.

8. No matter what direction you are traveling in, you must stop for
a school bus when the red lights are flashing (unless there is a
median). If you are following behind the school bus you should
stop at least 20 metres from the back of the bus. If you are coming
from the opposite direction, stop at a safe distance for children to
get off and cross the road in front of you.

72

\ EE i i

9, If a fire truck, ambulance, or police vehicle is approaching you
with their sirens on, you should pull over to the right and stop if it
is possible. Both sides of the traffic must obey this rule.

10. Always keep to the very right and only use the left lane for passing
(unless the examiner asks you to stay in another lane).

11. When approaching stop signs, make a complete stop and stop
at the appropriate place (refer to page 54). Follow the rule of the
first vehicle to stop will be the first vehicle to go, where there are

multiple stop signs.

12. Some test centres will test you on streets with one-way streets
(refer to page 67).

13. You may also be tested on three-point turns, parallel parking, left
and right turns at traffic lights, uphill or downhill parking, lane
changes and back-in or front-in parking techniques. These will be
tested in business and residential areas.

14. Don't forget to enter the correct lanes when there is a bus lane.

* Car A: do not turn in the bus lane

* Car B: turn into the bus lane first and then make a right turn

15. Listen carefully to the examiner's directions and remain calm. If
you could not hear what he/she said, you may ask them to repeat
themselves. Concentrate on your driving and keep both hands on
the steering wheel.

16. Avoid braking suddenly or accelerating quickly.

17. Reduce your speed a little if it is raining or snowing, however do
not drive too slow, follow the flow of traffic.

For the G2 road test:

The G2 Road Test can include everything that you were tested on in
your G1 Road Test as well as driving on the freeway and road side
stops. The G2 Road Test will be harder to pass as it assumes you are an
advanced driver. You should spend more time practicing and ensure
you are confident on the freeway. Refer to page 70 for freeway driving.
The test time is usually longer than your G1 Road Test.

Part lll: Things Every Driver Should Know

1. Winter Driving

In Canada, our weather is constantly changing and snow storms and
freezing rain are familiar obstacles. However, with a little preparation
and some common sense you can prevent accidents from occurring
and have essential items in case you get stranded on the road.

Things to do before the winter season begins:
1.

5

wn

Bring your vehicle in for a tune up and have them check your
vehicle. Use 5W/30 motor oil (a lighter form of motor oil) and
change your car’s coolant (at least every two years).

Use snow tires and change them well before the first snow fall. They
are highly recommended as they will prevent skidding and keep
you in control of your vehicle. Many winter accidents are caused
by drivers who are using their summer tires. Check your tire tread,
pressure and don’t forget to do the same for your spare tire.

Ensure your battery is in good condition. Your car needs more
power to start vour engine when temperatures are cold. A battery
in poor condition may leave you stranded in winter months. Keep
battery terminals clean, tight, free of corrosion and dry.

Always carry a first aid kit, ice scraper and brush, extra windshield
washing fluid (-40°C), gloves, blanket, flashlight, jumper cables,
bag of sand (for adding traction in case your vehicle gets stuck
in the snow), shovel and cell phone (on any cell phone you can
dial *OPP which will connect you to the nearest O.P.P.—Ontario
Provincial Police communications centre).

Change your windshield wipers (front and rear) when necessary
and constantly check your windshield fluid levels. Keeping your
windshields clear and visible will help prevent accidents.

Starting your vehicles in the winter time:

1.

Clear your vehicle of all ice and snow especially on all windows,

headlights and licence plate. Don't forget to brush off the snow on
the roof of your car as well

Unless the weather is below freezing, you do not need to warm up
your vehicle. If the temperature is below freezing you can warm

up your car for a few minutes, but driving slowly for the first few
minutes would be just as effective

Skid Control

lL;

In the case your vehicle begins to skid, do not
panic, release your foot from the gas pedal
and do not step on the brake abruptly

If the rear of your vehicle is skidding to the
right, turn your steering wheel to the right, if
the skid is to the left, turn to the left. Once you
have regained control straighten your steering
wheel and continue driving normally

[f you need to slow down or stop on icy roads, apply pressure on the
brake gently and avoid making sudden stops especially on turns

Keep an even greater distance to the vehicle in front of you

What you can do if you get stuck in the snow:

Use a shovel to clear any snow or ice that may be blocking your tires

Place a car mat under the wheels that are slipping and use low

gear to move forward. Have someone push the vehicle from
behind if possible

Use sand or salt under your tires to increase traction

Repeating the motion of moving your vehicle forward and then
backwards, can also help you when you are stuck. Ensure you are
fully stopped before switching from drive to reverse, or reverse to
drive (as damage to your transmission will occur if you do not)

Avoid allowing your wheels to spin on the same spot, ice will form
and make it even more difficult for you to get out

If you happen to be stranded in your vehicle or you are waiting
for a tow truck for a prolonged period of time, start your engine

every hour for ten minutes to keep your car warm and your
battery recharged

Open your window slightly to allow fresh air into the vehicle
Make sure your exhaust pipe is not blocked by the snow, as carbon

monoxide will enter your vehicle if it is

Th

Ema le Ae WEE PP de om oe

Long trips

2.

Plan your route with maps and check the weather report
before leaving

Notify your friends or family when you expect to arrive

* In areas of extreme cold you can use a block heater which is a
device that heats the engine by keeping the motor oil warm.

2. Tips for Buying a New or Used Car

Before buying a new or used car do a lot of research and talk to friends
or family and get their recommendations. There are many guides and
reviews in bookstores and online that you can use to make informed
decisions. Don’t forget to factor in the cost of regular maintenance,
fuel consumption, parking costs and insurance before purchasing your
vehicle. Read all fine print and documents before signing,

Buying a new vehicle:

Purchase a vehicle from a reputable
dealership

Compare prices between models,
safety features & gas consumption
New vehicles will also come with
warranties that cover the cost of
repair should something go wrong.
Note how long your warranty lasts and what is covered

New cars depreciate in value the moment you drive it off the
dealership lot, so make sure it is the vehicle you want

Buying a used car:

Check the year, model, mileage and examine the condition of
the vehicle

Ask questions such as has it been in any accidents? Minor or
major? Was regular maintenance done?

Check all components including the heating, air conditioning,
lights, etc.

Take it out for a test drive and turn off the radio and listen for
any sounds the car may make

It is a good idea to have a mechanic look at items such as the
brakes, oil leaks and over all condition of vehicle

Make sure the vehicle is free of debt and liens

All used vehicles must obtain a Safety Standard certificate
before the ownership is transferred

Since April 1999, all vehicles in Ontario must pass the Drive
Clean test every two years before a licence may be renewed

3. What to Do If You are Involved in an
Accident

Most accidents are caused by drivers who were driving too fast,

However, there are other reasons why accidents may occur. Some other
reasons are:

+ Lack of experience or knowledge

of the rules of the road, lack of

-

concentration, did not give right- — a

= NE

their life. Many accidents can be

avoided with a little common sense and just slowing down.

However if you are involved in an accident where the damage

exceeds $1,000 or there is personal injury, you must report this

to the police immediately. If the damage is under $1,000 and no
one has been hurt you may settle this on your own.

Accidents may involve further legal action against you. To
protect yourself it is a good idea to write down as much
information as possible. Here are a few steps you should follow:

Stop your car, turn off your engine and turn on your four-way
flashing signals. Wait until it is safe to exit your vehicle and leave
your vehicle where it is until the police arrive.

It someone is hurt call the police and/or ambulance as soon
as possible.

Stay calm, write down the other vehicle(s) licence plate, year,
make, model and colour. Also note how many passengers are in
the vehicle and if anyone is injured.

Ask the other drivers to see their driver's licence, write down their
name, address, driver licence number and phone number as well.
You should also get the driver's insurance policy and write down the
insurance company’s name, policy number and telephone number.

Get the contact information of witnesses just in case you need it.

Draw a small map of the roadway/intersection of the accident.
Make sure you write down the speed limits, road conditions,
directions of traffic and what damages were caused by the
accident. Also include if there are any traffic lights, tire marks left
on the road, or other road signs.

78

7. Write down the weather conditions (i.e. snow storm, raining, etc)
as well as if there was heavy traffic or construction.

8. When the police officer arrives, answer any question he/she may
have. Write down the officer's badge number, name, police station
and phone number (just in case you need to contact the officer in
the future).

9. If someone is badly hurt they may go into shock, find a blanket or
jacket to keep them warm. If bleeding occurs, use a clean cloth and
apply pressure. If itis possible, write down their name, hospital they
are going to, as well as their address and contact information.

10. Notify your insurance company and/or lawyer as soon as possible.

11. If necessary, call a tow truck and let them know where you would
like your vehicle towed to.

12. If your accident occurs on a highway, avoid stopping in the middle
of the highway and pull your vehicle to the side in a safe location
where you can wait until the police arrive. Try not to stay in your
car if you are in a dangerous area. Turn on your four-way flashing
lights or open your front hood so that other drivers can see you.

13. If you are in a rural area where a police office cannot be located,
you must report your accident within 24 hours to the nearest
police or O.P.P. station.

4. Car Care

Taking care of your vehicle by bringing it in for service regularly will
greatly prolong your vehicle's life and can reduce larger unnecessary
repair bills in the future.

To keep your vehicle in good shape there are things you can do:

1. Regularly:
o Check all lights
« Check motor oil level
« Check your radiator level
« Check your tire pressure

+ Wash your car
