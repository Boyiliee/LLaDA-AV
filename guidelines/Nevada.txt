GETTING YOUR NEVADA
DRIVER’S LICENSE

This chapter explains what is necessary to obtain a Nevada driver license, the tests you are required
to take, the DMV’s license classification system, and other general information about Nevada’s
requirements.
You need a Nevada driver license if you live or work in Nevada (excluding border state employees or
military members stationed in Nevada) and want to drive on Nevada streets and highways. Drivers
moving into Nevada from another state must apply for a license within 30 days after becoming a
resident.
To get a Nevada license, you will need to complete an application form and visit your local fullservice DMV office. You must also be at least 16 years old and provide proof of your full legal name,
age, Social Security Number if one has been issued to you, and Nevada residency. A Social Security
Number is not necessary to obtain a Driver Authorization Card (DAC).
A first-time Nevada driver license issued to persons under age 65 will be valid for eight years and
expires on your birthday unless limited-term immigration documents are presented as evidence of
your name and date of birth. If limited-term immigration documents are used, the expiration of your
driver license will coincide with the departure date that is electronically verified by the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), or one year if no date is provided by DHS. At no time will a driver license or
identification card be valid for more than eight years NRS 483.290.
483.290
Driver licenses for individuals aged 65 and older are valid for four years. Identification Cards are valid
for eight years.
If you are under 18 years old, a parent who has custody, a legal guardian, or other person authorized
by NRS 483.300 must co-sign your application. The co-signer shares liability for any damages caused
by the minor’s negligence or willful misconduct while driving.

New Nevada Residents
A resident of Nevada may hold only one driver’s license or identification card. If you have a license or
identification card from another jurisdiction (this includes the 50 United States and its territories and
foreign countries), you must surrender it to get a Nevada license or identification card. All surrendered
licenses and identification cards will be voided and returned to you.
Your vision will be tested when you apply for your Nevada driver’s license. All other tests may be waived
if all of these criteria apply:
•
•
•
•
•

You have had fewer than 3 moving violations in the past 4 years, and have not had your license
suspended, revoked, or canceled.
You have had no DUI convictions within the past 7 years.
You have no restrictions to your driving privilege that require evaluation.
You have a valid license from another state of the same license class for which you are applying
in Nevada.
You are age 21 or older.

You do not need a Nevada license if you are:
•
•

An active-duty member of the U.S. Armed Forces and you have a valid license from your home
state.
A non-resident, such as an out-of-state student, tourist or seasonal resident. If you want to drive
in Nevada, you must be at least 16 years old, have a valid license from your home state and
comply with Nevada traffic and financial responsibility laws.

Note: All driver records are checked through the national Problem Driver Pointer System and the
Commercial Driver’s License Information System. If your driving privilege is currently suspended,
revoked, canceled or denied in another state, you will not be allowed a Nevada license until the out-ofstate issue is resolved. You may qualify for an identification card during this period.
See Chapter 12 on vehicle registration for information on obtaining your Nevada license plates.

ocuments You Will Need

Evidence of Full Legal Name and Date of Birth
Applicants for a driver’s license or identification card must present an unexpired original or certified
copy of one of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

State-issued birth certificate (original or certified copy)
A valid, unexpired United States Passport or United States Passport Card
Nevada Department of Corrections identification card (not valid for a Real ID)
Consular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240)
A driver license, instruction permit, or identification card from another state that contains a
Real ID marking approved by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
— Any Real ID card that is marked as “limited term” is not acceptable for proof of name and

•
•

Certificate of Naturalization (N-550)
Certificate of Citizenship (N-560)

Permanent Residents
•

•
•

Permanent Resident Card (I-551)
— If a Resident Alien Card contains no expiration date, we can accept it as a “Permanent
Resident Card”. This is an old version of the card USCIS issued with no expiration dates.
While not currently required, USCIS recommends the holders of these cards replace them
with an updated version. DMV will not enforce the update, unless requested by DHS. Any
other version of the Resident Alien Card is not acceptable for proof of name, DOB, or lawful
status. Subject to change based on Department of Homeland Security policies.
Valid, unexpired Foreign Passport with an I-94 stamped “Processed for I-551.”
If the I-94 is expired, you must also present a Notice of Action (I-797) showing an approved
extension.

Limited-Term Residents
Any license or identification card issued using limited term documents will be marked “Limited
Term” on the face of the card.
•
•
•

Employment Authorization Card (I-766)
Valid, unexpired Foreign Passport with an unexpired U.S. Visa and an I-94 form.
If the I-94 is expired, you must also present a Notice of Action (I-797) showing an approved
extension.

Any immigration documents presented will be submitted for electronic verification of lawful status.

to present legal documentation reflecting your name change, such as a marriage certificate, divorce
decree (must reference a name change), spouse’s death certificate, adoption record or court order.
Documents must be original or certified copies.

Evidence of Social Security Number
You must present one of the following to obtain a driver license or identification card.
•
•
•
•

Social Security Card
W-2 (with full SSN)
IRS Form 1099
Paystub with full legal name. Handwritten paystubs are not acceptable.

All documents must be originals and must contain the complete Social Security Number. Alternative
documents for evidence of name, age, and Social Security Number may be approved by the
Department and will require supervisory approval. Alternative documents are not allowed for the
issuance of a Real ID card.

Real ID
The Real ID Act, passed by Congress in May 2005, requires Nevada to comply with new security laws.
The Real ID Act is intended to combat terrorism, identity theft, and other crimes by strengthening the
integrity and security of state-issued identification. This law sets identification standards for state
driver’s licenses and identification cards when used for boarding aircraft or entering federal buildings
where identification is required. Real ID licenses or ID cards are marked with a gold Nevada outline
and a star cutout, indicating the card meets federal identification standards. Standard licenses or ID
cards are marked with the phrase “NOT FOR REAL ID PURPOSES” indicating the card does not meet
federal identification standards.
Nevada customers have the option to obtain either a Real ID compliant or standard driver’s license or
identification card. The DMV is required to verify an applicant’s identity, date of birth, Social Security
number, lawful status, and primary residential address.
To meet the new requirements, applicants must present two documents proving Nevada residency.
Examples of acceptable documents are utility bills, mortgage statements, rental agreements, and bank
statements. All documents presented must display the applicant’s correct residential address.
If you currently hold a standard Nevada driver license and wish to upgrade to a Real ID, you must
show the proper documents to evidence your name, date of birth, Social Security number, and Nevada
residential address.
Any document presented to the DMV for proof of name, date of birth, Social Security number, or
lawful status is subject to scanning, storage, and electronic verification. The Real ID Act of 2005
sets standards for increased security and the privacy of personal information collected during the
application process for a driver license or identification card.

ndorsements

An endorsement allows you to drive a specific type of vehicle which requires more driving skill
than the typical vehicle. Various commercial and non-commercial vehicle endorsements may be
needed, depending on the type of vehicle you want to drive. Additional tests are required for these
endorsements.
Here are some endorsements you may need:
J – Class C vehicle; may tow vehicle(s) over 10,000 pounds GVWR

In a Class C vehicle, you may tow a vehicle (GVWR) or a combination of vehicles (GCWR) of more than
10,000 pounds. The combination of vehicles may not exceed 70 feet in length or have a combined
weight rating or a combined weight that exceeds 26,000 lbs. If the combination of the towing vehicle
and the towed vehicle(s) exceed 26,000 lbs., a Class A license is required.
F – Commercial License exemption for:

•
•

•

C

Firefighters while operating fire equipment
Farmers — employees or family members while transporting supplies within 150 miles to and
from the farm, if not:
— Employed as a common or contract motor carrier, or
— Transporting placarded amounts of hazardous materials
Military — if driving military vehicles on active military duty

ommercial Driver License (CDL)

Drivers of commercial motor vehicles have to meet strict licensing requirements and pass additional
knowledge and skills tests. A commercial motor vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle or combination of
motor vehicles used in commerce to transport passengers or property if the motor vehicle has a GVWR
or GCWR of 26,001 pounds or more, is designed to carry 16 or more passengers, including the driver,
or is carrying hazardous materials.
For more information about Nevada’s CDL program and licensing
requirements, please refer to the Commercial Driver License Handbook.

MOTORCYCLE SAFETY

PROGRAM

Passing an approved motorcycle
safety course may be substituted
for the motorcycle tests.
For more information, please call
the Nevada Motorcycle Safety
Program at 1-800-889-8779 or
visit nevadarider.com.

A motorcycle instruction permit allows you to practice driving when you are accompanied by and in
direct visual supervision of a licensed driver who:
•
•
•
•

Has a valid motorcycle license;
Is at least 21 years old;
Has at least one year of driving experience; and
Is also riding on a motorcycle at the time of supervision.

The licensed driver supervising you while on a motorcycle may not be in a car or truck.
When driving with a motorcycle instruction permit, you may drive during daylight hours only. You
may not carry passengers or drive on freeways or other high-speed roadways.
If you want a Nevada motorcycle driver license, you must (per NRS 486.071 and NRS 486.131):
•
•
•
•
•

Be at least 16 years old;
Pass a vision test;
Pass a general driver license knowledge test;
Pass a motorcycle knowledge test; and
Pass the Motorcycle Operators Skills Test (MOST).

The motorcycle drive test includes a pre-trip inspection. You need to know and understand your
motorcycle’s controls and equipment, such as the choke, gear-shift, brakes, spark arrester, starter,
throttle, ignition, and clutch.
The examiner will also check the turn signals and horn. Your drive test will include normal starts and
stops, quick stops, turns, and other maneuvers. When driving your motorcycle, you are required to
wear a helmet. If your motorcycle does not have a windshield or screen, you should wear a protective
face shield or goggles.
Failing the motorcycle skills test administered by the DMV two or more times will result in a
permanent denial of future motorcycle instruction permits per NRS 483.280.
If you are surrendering a valid motorcycle license or a valid driver license with a motorcycle
endorsement from another state, the road test may be waived.
Motorcycle handbooks are available at all DMV locations and on the website at dmv.nv.gov.

enewals

The expiration date is on the front of your driver license. Although a renewal notice is mailed to the
address on file, it is your responsibility to renew on or before your expiration date.
You may be required to pass a vision test, knowledge test, and an on-road driving skills test. Renewal
testing is used to re-evaluate driving knowledge, skills and abilities and to determine appropriate
restrictions.
Nevada does not automatically extend the license expiration date for military personnel. Active-duty
military personnel who are temporarily out-of-state may renew a Nevada license through the mail.

Change of Address or Name
Under Nevada law, you are required to notify the DMV of any address or name change within 30 days.
Address Changes
When you need to change the address on your driver license, driver authorization card or identification
card, you may do so online at dmv.nv.gov, by going to your local DMV office, or through the mail.
Address changes must be completed in person if you hold a commercial driver license.
If you choose to request an address change by mail, you can download the Change of Address
Application (DMV-22) from the website dmv.nv.gov.
Name Changes
Name changes must be made in person at a local DMV office. You will be asked to complete an
application and provide acceptable legal documentation reflecting your name change.

uplicate License

If your driver license becomes illegible, lost, or stolen, you need to apply for a duplicate immediately.
You may apply online or in person at the DMV. When you go to the DMV, it is best to bring as much
identification documentation as possible. This will help confirm your identity and speed up the
process. The DMV may use your existing record and photograph currently on file when necessary. See
the “Documents You Will Need” section in this chapter for more information.

I

dentification Cards

A Nevada identification card is valid for eight years and expires on your birthday unless limitedterm immigration documents are presented as evidence of name and date of birth. If limited-term
immigration documents are used, the expiration will coincide with your departure date or one year
from issuance if no date is listed. If you want a Nevada identification card, you must:
•
•
•

Be at least 10 years old;
Complete an application; and
Present the proof of identity as outlined under “Documents You Will Need” in this chapter.

Issuance of an identification card will automatically surrender your driving privileges or an
identification card issued from Nevada or another state whether or not the card is in your
possession. This does not apply if you are a seasonal resident identification card applicant.
If you are cited for a traffic violation while holding a Nevada identification card, citations and demerits
will be applied to “future driving privileges” and the same rules and penalties will apply to you as apply
to driver license holders. If you receive 12 or more demerits in a 12-month period, you will be required
to reinstate your driving privileges before you are eligible to receive a driver license.
You may apply for a duplicate identification card online or in person at the DMV. If you need to update
information on your identification card, please contact your local DMV office at one of the locations
listed in Chapter 13 of this handbook.

V

eteran Designation

When applying for your initial or a renewal license or identification card, you have the opportunity to
declare yourself as an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Armed Forces.
To make this declaration, bring an honorable discharge or other document of honorable separation
from the United States Armed Forces to certify an honorable discharge when you come to the DMV for
your license. You will also be asked to sign a written release authorizing the Department to provide
personal information to the Nevada Department of Veterans Services.

uman Trafficking – No Child for Sale

Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery through the use
of force, fraud, or coercion to subject people into a life of sexual
objectivity and the performance of sexual acts for financial gains.
Every year, millions of men, women, and children are trafficked
in countries around the world, including the United States. It
is estimated that human trafficking generates billions of dollars
per year, second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable
form of transnational crime. Human trafficking is a hidden crime
as victims rarely come forward to seek help because of language
barriers, fear of the traffickers, and/or fear of law enforcement.

OBLUE

CAMPAIGN

One Voice. One Mission. End Human Trafficking.®

dhs.gov/blue-campaign

The Nevada DMV is proud to work with partners such as the Department
of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign and Truckers Against Trafficking
in the fight against this horrendous crime.
Recognizing key indicators of human trafficking is the first step in
identifying victims and can help save a life. Not all indicators listed are
present in every situation, and the presence or absence of any of the
indicators is not necessarily proof of human trafficking.

Sex Trafficking Red Flags
•
•
•
•

Lack of knowledge of their community or whereabouts
Not in control of own identification documents (ID/passport)
Restricted or controlled communication--not allowed to speak for themselves
Demeanor - fear, anxiety, depression, submissive, tense, nervous

Help for Victims
To get help, call or text the National Human Trafficking Hotline:
•
•

1-888-373-7888
Text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733)

Report Suspicious Activity
Report suspected human trafficking to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security:
•

1-866-347-2423 or ice.gov/tips.

For law enforcement to open an investigation on your tip, they need “actionable information.” Specific
tips helpful when reporting to the hotline would include:
•
•
•
•

Descriptions of cars (make, model, color, license plate number, etc.) and people (height, weight,
hair color, eye color, age, etc.)
Take a picture if you safely can.
Specific times and dates (When did you see the event? What day was it?)
Addresses and locations where suspicious activity took place.

Do not at any time attempt to confront a suspected trafficker directly or alert a victim to your
suspicions. Your safety as well as the victim’s safety is paramount.

BUCKLE UP

Seat belts are your best protection against injury or death if you are in a vehicle crash. In 2020,
23.03% of highway fatalities in Nevada were drivers who were NOT wearing their seat belts. This is a
1.15% increase from 2016 statistics. Between 2016 and 2020, 345 unbelted vehicle occupants lost
their lives.
In Nevada, seat belts aren’t just a good idea – they are the law.
•
•
•
•

•
•

If your car is a 1968 model or newer, it must have lap-type seat belts for passengers in the
front seat.
If it is a 1970 model or newer, it must have lap-type seat belts for each passenger of the
vehicle. It must also have shoulder harnesses for use in the front seat.
The driver and any passengers age six and older must wear safety belts if the vehicle is
equipped with them.
Children under age six and those who measure less than 57 inches tall must be in an approved
child restraint system pursuant per NRS 484B.157. Failure to restrain children under age six
and those measuring less than 57 inches may result in fines, community service, and/or the
suspension of your driver’s license.
Children under the age of two must be secured in a rear-facing child restraint system in the
back seat of the motor vehicle.
A child should never be held in a lap or buckled with someone else into a single safety belt.

Unattended Children and Pets
Never leave a child aged 7 or younger unattended in a vehicle if the conditions present a significant
risk to the health and safety of that child unless the child is being supervised by and is within sight of a
person at least 12 years old. NRS 202.485
It is illegal to leave a dog or cat unattended in a vehicle during periods of extreme heat or cold. Law
enforcement, firefighters and other officials may use reasonable force to rescue the animal. NRS 202.487
Violations of these laws are misdemeanor offenses.

25

T

raveling with Babies and Children

Booster seats and belt-positioning seats are designed to elevate or position a child so as to allow them
to be safely secured with a seat belt. If you are traveling with children, ask yourself:
•
•
•

Is your child restraint system approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation in
accordance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards?
Is your seat appropriate for the size and weight of the child?
Has the seat been installed safely, securely and in accordance with the installation instructions
provided by the manufacturer or in another manner approved by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration?

Always buckle up infants facing the rear of the car.
Children under 2 must ride in a rear-facing child safety seat in the back
seat of the vehicle. The rear-facing safety seat supports a baby’s head,
protecting the neck and spine from injury in most crashes.

Teach children to ride buckled up in the back seat.
The back seat generally is the safest place in the car. Older children
may ride in the front if necessary, but the vehicle seat should be moved
back as far as possible. To protect the head from contact with a rapidly
inflating airbag, use a child restraint with a complete harness system
or a properly fitted vehicle shoulder/lap belt. Passengers who are not
buckled up or who sit too close to airbags can suffer serious injuries,
even in a minor collision or a sudden stop.

Never put an infant in the front seat if the car has a passenger
side airbag.
In a crash, the airbag explodes from the dashboard at 200 mph, smashing
through the safety seat into the back of the baby’s head. Safe driving depends on
you, your skill, your knowledge, your abilities and your attitude.

DRIVING SAFELY

etting Ready to Drive

Before you start the engine
•
•
•
•
•

Adjust the driver’s seat to improve visibility and so all controls can be comfortably reached.
Make sure the windshield and windows are clean.
Buckle up! And make sure your passengers do, too.
Check your attitude. Are you calm and in control?
Check the rear and side mirrors and make sure they are properly adjusted.

When you turn on the engine
•
•
•

Check fuel level and warning lights.
Adjust the volume on your stereo system. Can you hear normal traffic sounds? If not, reduce
the volume so they can be heard.
If needed, turn on headlights, turn signal and windshield wipers.

Before you move your vehicle
•

Stop, look and listen for traffic, bicyclists and pedestrians.

Tire Safety
Prior to entering the vehicle, using a tire pressure gauge, check tire pressure using the recommended
pounds per square inch (psi) located in the vehicle owner’s manual or the driver’s side door jamb of
the vehicle. If needed, adjust your psi to the recommended level.
Once every month, or before you go on a long road trip, check tires for wear and damage problems.
One easy way to check for wear is by using the “penny test.”
•
•
•

Take a penny and hold Abraham Lincoln’s body between your thumb and forefinger.
Select a point on your tire where the tread appears to be lowest and place Lincoln’s head into
one of the grooves.
If any part of Lincoln’s head is covered by the tread, the tire has a safe amount of tread. If the
tread goes below that, the car’s ability to grip the road in adverse conditions is greatly reduced.

he Rules of the Road

The rules of the road are the traffic laws and driving practices that mean safe driving for all of us.
These rules include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Signs, signals and highway markings;
Right of way;
Controlling speed;
Freeway driving;
Stopping;
Signaling, turning, lane changes and passing; and
Parking.

Signs, signals, and highway markings are used alone and in combination to control traffic and make
safe driving easier.

S

igns, Signals and Markings

Signs
Signs have three purposes: they regulate, warn, and inform. The shapes and colors of highway signs
have special meanings. This helps you understand the message quickly.
Standard colors:
•
•

•
•
•

Red — no, do not, or stop
Green — direction or guidance
Yellow or yellow green — general warning
White — regulatory, law, or rule
Orange — road construction or repair

CROSSING

28

Stop signs mean you must:
•
•
•

Come to a full stop behind the stop sign at the crosswalk or stop line. If the
view of the cross street is blocked, slowly move forward to determine when it
is safe to proceed.
If no signs or markings exist, slow down and stop, if necessary, at the point
nearest the intersection where there is a view of approaching traffic on the
through roadway.
Give right-of-way to pedestrians and to any cross traffic before moving
forward.

STOP

At a four-way stop, wait for other vehicles already in the intersection. Allow vehicles that reach the
intersection before you to go first. Wait your turn!
Yield signs mean the same as stop signs except you may proceed without coming
to a full stop if it is safe to do so. You must:
•
•
•
•
•

Slow down upon approaching the intersection.
Give the right-of-way to pedestrians and through traffic.
Yield the right-of-way to drivers already on the highway.
Check in all directions for cross traffic before entering the intersection to
avoid a collision.
Yield the right-of-way to vehicles making a U-turn from an intersection.

You must yield the right-of-way to any police vehicle, fire engine, ambulance, or other emergency
vehicle using a siren and red lights. Drive to the right edge of the road and stop until the emergency
vehicle(s) have passed. However, never stop in an intersection.

I
Regulatory signs are rectangular and have a white background. They inform you
of traffic laws and regulations. You must obey these signs.

SPEED
LIMIT

11

50

Warning signs are yellow, diamond-shaped, with black letters and symbols. They
tell the driver there are special conditions or hazards ahead.

Railroad crossing signs warn drivers of the need to slow down and possibly
stop for a train. The crossbuck (X) marks the actual location of the train tracks.
Drivers should look both ways when approaching the crossing and always stay
clear of the tracks when a train is approaching.

Route signs and markers are usually shaped like a shield, but there are different
shapes and colors. These signs show U.S., Interstate and state route numbers.

29

Construction and maintenance signs are used to notify drivers of
possible danger in or near work areas. Most signs used in highway
and street work areas are diamond-shaped.
Cones, drums, and barricades are used to alert you and to guide you
safely through work areas. For night work, they may be equipped
with warning lights.
When used, drivers must slow down and follow the direction of the
posted signs and any construction flaggers who may be present.
Violations in work zones result in increased traffic fines.

Signals
Traffic signals control traffic at intersections. Combinations of traffic and pedestrian signals, signs,
pavement markings, and other traffic control devices may be used in some situations.
When traffic control lights are not working, drivers must come to a full stop before proceeding
through the intersection. After yielding to pedestrians and other vehicles that have already
stopped or are in the intersection, drivers may proceed with caution.
A red light means STOP. Drivers must come to a complete stop before they reach the
intersection. Stop your vehicle behind the crosswalk or stop line. If there is no stop
line or crosswalk, stop before entering the intersection. Remain stopped until the light
turns green. Where not prohibited by signs, a right turn may be made on a red light
after coming to a complete stop. Signal for a right turn, then turn when motor and
pedestrian traffic is clear and it is safe to proceed.
A yellow light means CAUTION. A steady yellow light is a warning that the light will
be turning red. If a driver has not entered the intersection, they must stop. If they are
already in the intersection, they should continue moving and clear it safely. DO NOT
speed up to “beat the light.”
A green light means drivers may go straight ahead, turn right or turn left unless a sign forbids the
turn.
A flashing red light means that drivers must come to a full stop. They may go only when the road is
clear and they have the right-of-way. The signal has the same meaning as a stop sign.
A flashing yellow light means drivers may proceed with caution.
A red arrow means drivers cannot make the movement shown by the arrow. The red arrow may be
shown alone or with another signal. Unless entering the intersection to make a movement allowed by
another signal, drivers facing a red arrow must stop.
A yellow arrow means the signal is going to change to red and warns drivers to clear the intersection.
A flashing yellow arrow means drivers must yield to oncoming traffic and pedestrians. They may
complete the turn when it is safe to do so.
A green arrow means drivers may go in the direction shown by the arrow, but they must yield to
pedestrians, bicycles and traffic already in the intersection. When a green turn arrow is showing, the
turn is protected from other traffic.
Drivers may make a left turn at a red light only when you are turning from a one-way street onto
another one-way street that has traffic moving to the left. Drivers must signal, come to a complete
stop, and yield right-of-way to pedestrians and all other traffic that is moving as directed by the signal.
Drivers may make these turns unless a sign, arrow signal or police officer directs them not to turn.
30

Pedestrian Crossing
Pedestrians crossing at an intersection must also obey traffic signals.
•

A red light means “do not cross” unless a pedestrian signal or police officer directs otherwise.

•

A yellow light means caution. It warns that the light is changing from green to red. The
purpose of the yellow light is to allow vehicles already in the intersection to proceed safely.
Pedestrians facing a yellow light must not start across the street unless a crosswalk signal or
police officer directs them.

•

A green light means pedestrians facing the green light may cross the intersection unless a
pedestrian signal or police officer directs otherwise.
Pedestrians facing a green turn arrow are not to cross unless a pedestrian signal or police
officer allows them to do so.
If a crosswalk is marked, pedestrians are to use the marked area.

Walk and Don’t Walk Signals
Walk/Don’t Walk signals are special stop-and-go lights for pedestrians. If these signals are in place,
pedestrians are to obey them. This may also be indicated by a lighted pedestrian figure or hand
symbol in the signal.
•

WALK or Walking Person Symbol: If illuminated, it means
pedestrians facing the signal may proceed to cross the
roadway in the direction of the signal and must be given the
right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.

Did You Know...
The majority of pedestrian
fatalities
occur between
intersections
(mid-block).

•

DON’T WALK, Wait, or Upraised Hand Symbol: If
illuminated, flashing, and accompanied by countdown timer,
pedestrians may proceed across the roadway in the direction
of the signal but must complete the crossing before the
countdown time gets to zero.

•

DON’T WALK: While the Don’t Walk or wait indication or an upraised hand symbol is
illuminated and flashing but is not accompanied by a countdown timer, a pedestrian may not
proceed across the roadway. A pedestrian who entered the roadway lawfully may continue to
cross the roadway, but must proceed to a curb, sidewalk, safety zone (if one is provided), or
other place of safety before the Don’t Walk or Wait indication and/or upraised hand symbol is
illuminated and steady.

•

DON’T WALK: while the “Don’t Walk” or “Wait” indication or an upraised hand symbol is
illuminated and steady, a pedestrian may not proceed to cross the roadway. A pedestrian who
entered the roadway lawfully may continue to cross the roadway but must proceed to a curb,
sidewalk, safety zone (if one is provided) or other place of safety as soon as possible.

Both drivers and pedestrians are responsible for safe use of our roadways. Drivers should always be
prepared to yield to pedestrians.

31

Highway Markings
Like signs, highway markings warn, regulate, and inform. Markings are white and yellow, and each
type of line has a special meaning.
•

Broken or dashed white lines are used to mark traffic lanes on roads which have more than
one lane moving in the same direction. You should drive within these lanes and not straddle
the lines. Passing is permitted when it is safe to do so [see picture (A) below].

•

Solid white lines are used in several ways. When solid white lines separate lanes of traffic
moving in the same direction, do not change lanes or pass. A solid white line is also used to
mark the edge of the highway as well as the boundary between a travel lane and a highway
shoulder.

•

Yellow lines separate lanes of traffic moving in
opposite directions.

I

•

Broken or dashed yellow lines mean you may
pass when it is safe to do so [see (B)].

•

Crosswalk lines are marked by solid white lines or various patterns. Vehicles should
always be stopped before the crosswalk. At some intersections, especially in small towns or
residential areas, crosswalks may not be marked. Drivers still must yield to pedestrians in the
intersection.

•

Stop lines are the wide white lines painted across a
traffic lane where you must stop before you enter the
intersection. You should be able to see traffic coming
from all directions.

•

Dotted white lines may either indicate an extension
of a lane line through an intersection or may indicate
exit-only lanes on a freeway.

•

Center lanes for left turns appear on many streets and
roads. Most are marked on each side by solid yellow
and broken yellow lines. Drivers may cross these lines
only to make a left turn onto or from the highway.
These are not travel lanes and may not be used for
passing. Drivers may not travel more than 200 feet in
a center turn lane before making a left-hand turn and
they may not travel more than 50 feet in a center lane
after making a left-hand turn onto the highway before
merging with traffic per NRS 484B.223 (3).

Railroad Crossings
Traffic control systems for railroad crossings may include signals, signs, lights, and markings. When
drivers see the round railway crossing sign, they should slow down, be ready to stop, and remember:
•
•

To look both ways, even if there is no stop sign or signal that a train is coming.
If there is a stop sign at the crossing, drivers must stop. If a train is coming, drivers must stop
at least 15 feet from the tracks.
• Even if there is no stop signal and no train is coming, passenger buses and trucks carrying
flammable or dangerous materials must stop.
• Do not shift gears while crossing the tracks.
• If a driver is stopped at a crossing where there is more than one set
of tracks, they must wait until there is a clear view in both directions
before starting across.
• Trains cannot stop in time to miss cars.
• It is difficult to accurately judge the speed of a moving train.
• A crossbuck sign indicates the location of a train crossing and means
drivers must yield to trains.
• If a gate is lowered, you may not proceed around it even if a train is
not visible.
REPORT EMERGENCY
• If the signal lights are flashing, drivers must stop. They may proceed if
OR PROBLEM
no train is visible or it is safe to cross.
• If a driver gets stuck on the tracks, they should leave the vehicle
TO 1-800-555-5555
immediately, locate the Blue Emergency Notification System sign at
CROSSING 836 597 H
the railroad crossing and notify the railroad and local law enforcement.
• Never park within 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad.

School Areas
Traffic controls in school zones may include a combination of signs, signals, markings, and school
crossing guards. Violating the direction of a school crossing guard is a misdemeanor in Nevada.
If a crossing guard is present in a school zone crosswalk, motorists must wait until the guard is
completely out of the crosswalk before proceeding.
In school zones, the speed limit is either 15 or 25 mph.
These speed limits are in effect on school days from a half
hour before school begins to a half hour after school ends,
unless otherwise posted.

~SCHOOL~

Some areas may use flashing yellow lights to tell drivers
when the speed limit is in effect. These lights may be
turned off during hours students are actually in classes.
If so, the speed limit then reverts to that posted for nonschool hours.

15

LIMIT

8:30A.M.

I T0S:30 P.M.

Signs and signals clearly show these speed limits and either designate the hours
when the speed limit is in effect or state that the speed limit is in effect when children are present.

Nevada law prohibits the operator of a vehicle from making a U-turn in a school zone except when
there are no children present, it is a day when no school is in session, on school days from half an
hour after schools ends to a half hour before the next school session begins or when the signs/lights
designate that the school zone is currently not in effect.

Slow down and watch for children!

ight-of-Way

Right-of-way rules help traffic move smoothly through intersections. They emphasize courtesy,
common sense, and cooperation. Failure to yield the right-of-way is the leading cause of crashes
in Nevada.
Generally, right-of-way means the right of one vehicle to go before another one.
The term also applies to pedestrians and bicycle riders. Nevada law does not give
anyone the “right-of-way” — it only says who must yield. Even when you may
legally have the right-of-way, you must do everything possible to avoid a crash.
•
•
•
•

At an intersection where there are no traffic signs or signals, the vehicle
on your right should usually go first. If you have the right-of-way and
others yield it to you, proceed through the intersection with caution.
A vehicle already in the intersection has the right-of-way over others just
getting there.
A vehicle going straight ahead that is already in the intersection has the
right-of-way over one turning left. After yielding (and properly signaling),
the vehicle turning left then has the right-of-way.
Vehicles entering a main road from a minor road, private road or
driveway must yield the right-of-way to all traffic on the main road and to
pedestrians.

Other right-of-way rules are:
•

•
•
•
•

The right-of-way must be given to emergency vehicles approaching from
any direction when they are sounding a siren or using their flashing
lights. You must immediately drive to the right side of the road, clear of
any intersection, and stop until the emergency vehicle has passed.
At a four-way stop, the driver reaching the intersection first gets to go
first, after stopping completely.
When entering a freeway, yield the right-of-way to traffic on the freeway.
You may enter only when it is safe to do so.
Yield right-of-way to bicyclists riding on a bike path or lane.
Yield to funeral processions and let the vehicles with headlights on pass
as a group.

Pedestrian Right-of-Way
•
•
•

Pedestrians in crosswalks and at intersections have the right-of-way over vehicles.
Although pedestrians have the right-of-way in a crosswalk and at intersections, vehicles don’t
always stop. Before pedestrians step off the curb, they should make certain cars in both
directions have stopped. Don’t put yourself or anyone else in the position for a potential crash.
A person who is blind or visually impaired, on foot and using a guide dog or other service
animal, or carrying a white cane or walking stick, has the right-of-way on a highway, street or
road in this state. A driver must yield the right-of-way, come to a full stop if necessary, and
take precautions before proceeding to avoid a crash or injury. NRS 484B.290

See Chapter 6 - Sharing the Road for more information on pedestrian safety.

ontrolling Speed

Nevada has a Basic Rule for driving at a “reasonable or proper” speed. This means that in addition to
any posted speed limits, drivers must consider:
•
•
•
•

The amount and type of traffic
The weather and the distance you can see
The condition of the road surface; that is, whether it is
dry, wet, icy or snow-covered
The type of road:
— whether it is flat and straight or steep and curvy
— whether it is wide or narrow

It also means that drivers are never to drive at a speed that
endangers you or anyone else. Depending on conditions, the
safe speed may be considerably less than the posted speed
limit.
EXAMPLES OF SPEED LIMITS IN NEVADA
15 mph .............. School zones
25 mph ............. Business and residential areas and school
zones
35 mph
45 mph ............. Reduced speed areas going into towns
55 mph
65 mph ............. Urban freeways, rural highways
70+ mph ............ Rural interstate freeways

Did You Know...
Driving too slowly
can also be unsafe.
Not only can this
cause traffic to
stack up — it may
also cause other
drivers to become impatient
and attempt passing when it is
not safe. When there are two
or more lanes of traffic moving
in the same direction, slower
traffic must move to the right
and allow other drivers to pass.

Remember: Speed limits are set for normal driving conditions. When bad weather makes it hard to see
or makes the road slick, drivers need to adjust their speed.
Most people who speed do so to save time. Let’s look at how much or how little time is actually saved.
To travel 5 miles:
At 70 mph takes 4 minutes, 17 seconds. Savings over 60 mph = 43 seconds
At 60 mph takes 5 minutes. Savings over 55 mph = 27 seconds
At 55 mph takes 5 minutes, 27 seconds
To travel 15 miles:
At 70 mph takes 12 minutes, 51 seconds. Savings over 60 mph = 2 minutes, 9 seconds
At 60 mph takes 15 minutes. Savings over 55 mph = 1 minute, 22 seconds
At 55 mph takes 16 minutes, 22 seconds
The next time a driver wants to speed, they should ask:
Why am I in a hurry?
Does it really matter?
Is it worth endangering myself and others?
And consider: If drivers are stopped and given a ticket, it will cost them both time and money!

reeway Driving

Freeways are usually the safest roads. Access is limited, traffic moves in the same direction without
stops, and there are no intersections, sharp curves, traffic signals, or railroad crossings. Even so,
drivers need good driving knowledge, skills, and attitudes to get to their destinations safely.
Before drivers start, they should plan their route. If you’re unsure of how to get where you’re going,
reference a map before driving. Know the entrances and exits and check the gas gauge!

Entering a Freeway
•

Drivers should use the on-ramp when you enter the
freeway. Signs will say “Do Not Enter” and “Wrong Way” if
they have made a mistake.

•

Using the merge or acceleration lane, look for an opening in
traffic. Use your turn signal and accelerate to - or near - the
speed of freeway traffic. Do not stop before merging unless
necessary; a stop can mean a slow and dangerous start into
fast-moving traffic and can affect traffic behind the driver.

•

As you enter from a merging lane, you must yield to traffic
already on the freeway. If you are already traveling on the
freeway, watch for merging traffic and adjust your speed to
allow for safe and smooth merges.

•

Driving speeds are frequently faster on freeways than on
other highways, even though they may have the same
posted speed limits. This is because there are fewer stopand-go situations. Stay with the flow of traffic.

•

Freeways have several lanes in each direction. On these
roads, drivers should leave the extreme left lane for faster
traffic. Remember, lane hopping is always dangerous,
annoys other drivers, increases the risk of a crash, and
seldom saves time.

seconds
or more

IDENTIFY
GAP

Speed

•

Stay alert! Be prepared for rapid changes in road conditions
and traffic flow. Look ahead much farther down the road at least 20 to 30 seconds.

•

Watch traffic all around the vehicle. Be aware of other
drivers who are changing lanes, passing, or slowing down.

•

Use mirrors and quickly look over your shoulder to check your vehicle’s blind spot before
changing lanes. Use turn signals to let other drivers know where your vehicle is going and
watch for signals from other vehicles.

Ramp Meters
If a freeway entrance is equipped with ramp meters and they are switched on, you must:

36

•

Pull up to the stop line and stop at a red light;

•

Be alert. The signal will change more rapidly than a signal at an intersection;

•

Wait for the green light; and finally

•

When the light turns green, proceed along the ramp and merge onto the freeway safely.

Some freeway entrance ramps have more than one travel lane and each lane
is controlled by its own ramp meter. Motorists are encouraged to use both
lanes and abide by the ramp meter signal controlling their lane of travel.
Some metered freeway ramps have High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) bypass
lanes, also known as carpool lanes. These lanes are marked with a diamond
on the pavement and are not metered. If you are in a carpool of two or more
people, you may use the HOV ramp meter bypass lane without stopping.

drivers should exercise caution.

A yellow X with MERGE means the lane is ending and the driver
should prepare to safely merge into another open lane.

A red X with CLOSED means drivers cannot drive in the lane under
the red X. There could be many reasons for the lane closure. For
the driver’s safety and the safety of others, do not drive in this lane.
Drivers must safely merge into another open lane.

Overhead Freeway Signals
In the example on the next page, starting at the bottom of the figure, signals display that the speed
limit has been reduced due to a crash ahead.
As a driver gets closer to the crash, the signals will provide updated information regarding lane
closures and reduced speed limits. Once drivers pass the crash, the signals indicate all lanes are once
again open.
These signals will be used anytime there are lane closures or reduced speed limits due to construction,
debris, a crash or any other reason that becomes necessary.

High-Occupancy Vehicle Lanes
High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes are one or more lanes of a roadway that have restrictions on
use to encourage ridesharing. The goal of HOV lanes is to provide an incentive to use ridesharing
and public transportation, remove congestion from normal lanes of travel, and improve overall traffic
operations.

Exiting a Freeway
Most freeway exits have a special lane for drivers to use before you reach the exit ramp. Avoid slowing
down on the freeway itself. Wait until you are in the deceleration lane. Then, slow down gradually until
your speed matches the posted exit ramp speed.
•

Look ahead for signs for the exit you want and the lane you need to use.

•

Check in front, behind, and to the side for traffic. Signal and move into the proper lane a mile
or more before the exit. Most exits are numbered to help you quickly spot the one you want to
take. These numbers are also usually listed on the major freeway signs.

•

If you miss the exit ramp, never turn around or back up. Go to the next exit, get back on the
freeway in the opposite direction, and return to the exit.

A

nti-Lock Braking Systems

ABS stands for anti-lock braking system. Anti-lock brakes prevent skidding and allow drivers to steer
during an emergency braking situation.
You can find out whether your car has ABS by looking for an illuminated ABS symbol on the
dashboard right after starting the engine, checking the owner’s manual, or asking the dealer.
You will know your ABS is not working if the ABS symbol stays lighted on the dashboard long after
the car has started. The conventional brakes will continue to work even when the ABS does not. If this
happens, follow the traditional lessons for emergency braking or stopping situations.
There are two types of ABS: four-wheel ABS and rear-wheel ABS.
It is easy to use four-wheel ABS once drivers know how. In simple terms, all drivers must do is brake
and steer: push the brake pedal down hard, hold it down firmly and steer in the direction you want
the car to go.
Many drivers have been instructed that the correct way to stop in an emergency situation where
traction is lost and the vehicle slides is to pump the brakes. While this may be correct with
conventional brakes, it’s different with four-wheel ABS. In an emergency situation, ABS pumps the
brakes automatically at a much faster rate than the driver ever could.
Four-wheel ABS works like this: Whenever the vehicle’s computer detects that one or more wheels are
locking, ABS begins to pump the brakes to avoid locking. The driver needs to press hard on the brake
pedal, hold it down and steer out of danger.
Drivers should not:
•

Turn the steering wheel hard or jerk it in one direction. Jerking the wheel too far can cause the
vehicle to end up in the emergency stopping lane or on the shoulder of the road.

Drivers should:
•
•
•

Maintain control by steering where you want to go.
Check that traffic is clear when you decide where to steer.
Steer back into the original lane as soon as the hazard is cleared.

Rear-wheel anti-lock brakes are found only on some light trucks. They prevent the rear wheels from
locking up so the back end of the vehicle does not skid sideways. However, the front wheels can still
lock up and cause the driver to lose steering control. If this happens, you should let up on the brake
pedal just enough to allow the front wheels to start rolling again to regain steering control.
Drivers should be aware that removing steady pressure from the brake pedal or pumping the brakes
will disengage, or “turn off,” the ABS.

S

topping

The ability to judge how much time and space you need to stop your vehicle is a major part of safe
driving. The rear-end collision is the number one crash type on Nevada’s streets and highways.
Your stopping distance depends upon many factors, such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The type and weight of the vehicle you are driving.
Your speed.
The condition of the tires and brakes.
The road surface.
Your reaction time.
How alert or how tired you are.
Weather conditions.

To stop your vehicle, three things must occur:
•
•
•

You have to see and understand the reason for stopping (“perception”).
Your brain has to send a message telling your foot to step on the brake pedal (“reaction”).
Your foot has to move to the brake pedal and push down.

These three things together are called “Perception and Reaction Distance.” The amount of time it takes
from the time you see that you need to stop until you step on the brakes is called “reaction time.”
Reaction time increases as driving decisions become more complex or when unexpected events occur.
Highway safety studies show normal reaction times are 2 to 2.5 seconds.
Stopping your vehicle also involves braking time and distance.
•
•

“Braking time” is how much time it takes for the brakes and friction between the road and tires
to stop your vehicle.
“Braking distance” is how far your vehicle travels during this time.

The most important point for any driver to remember is that if you double your speed – say from 30
mph to 60 mph – your braking distance does not become twice as long. It becomes four times as long.
Stopping distances on a wet highway may be more than double those on dry pavement. Be especially
careful during the first rain of a season because the mixture of oil and water on pavement is very
dangerous. Stopping distances on packed snow and ice are greatly increased. For example, if you are
going 30 mph, your stopping distance on ice would be 373 feet, well over the length of a football field.
Most cars will begin to lose traction and hydroplane between speeds of 35 and 55 mph in heavy
rainfall. When this happens, you lose control of your vehicle. Slow down.

efensive Driving Tips

Giving yourself time and space to stop is easier if you use these defensive driving guidelines.
•

Look ahead at least 12 seconds. This means at a minimum
you look ahead to where your vehicle will be 12 seconds from
now.

SEARCH

12 seconds or more

To figure how far this is, choose a fixed object in front of
you and begin counting, “one thousand one, one thousand
two, etc.” until the front of your vehicle passes the object. If
you have not reached “one thousand twelve,” you need to be
looking farther ahead. For example, at 30 mph you should see
a little over a block ahead.
The 12-second rule allows you to watch traffic patterns and
react to changes. When you are driving at freeway speeds you
need to look ahead at least 20 to 30 seconds.
•

Stay behind at least two seconds. If you are driving 40 mph
or less, stay at least two seconds behind the vehicle in front
of you. This is a minimum following distance. Most driving
instructors recommend up to four seconds. To figure this, start
counting “one thousand one” when the rear of a vehicle ahead
passes a fixed point, such as a sign. If you reach the sign
before you have counted “one thousand two,” you are following
too closely.
Remember, the two-second rule is a minimum following
distance. As your speed increases, so does the time and
distance required for you to stop. For example, if you are
traveling at 55 mph, you would need almost seven seconds
to stop with perfect brakes and ideal road conditions. So at
highway speeds or at any speed when streets and roads are
slippery and visibility is reduced, allow a safe distance between
you and the next vehicle.

42

•

Give yourself room to maneuver. In traffic, this involves the
speed you are traveling and your lane position. You want to
be between the clusters of vehicles in front of and behind you.
You also want to choose a lane position that allows you the
most options for movement.

•

Intersections. When approaching an intersection, it is
important to look in all directions. You should look left, right,
and left again just before entering the intersection.

hat to Do if You Are Stopped by Law Enforcement

Moving violations are the most common reason a vehicle is stopped by law enforcement. Some
examples include speeding offenses, failure to stop at a light or sign, failure to use a signal, or failure
to drive within the marked lanes. Courtesy and safety concerns are other reasons an officer might stop
your car. It is not uncommon for a driver to be in violation of the law without knowing it.
What should you do when you see red lights flashing in the rearview mirror? Pull over and stop!
Drivers who are stopped by law enforcement officers are encouraged to follow these instructions:
•

Stop your vehicle as far out of the lane of traffic as possible. Stay in your vehicle. If you are
stopped at night, turn on the interior light. Good lighting assists good communication. If you
leave the vehicle, you subject yourself and the officer to danger from nearby traffic.

•

Keep your hands in plain view at all times (preferably on the steering wheel) and refrain from
making any sudden movements. Wait for the officer to request your license, registration and
evidence of insurance.

•

Officers are trained to ask for identification first and provide an explanation of why the driver
was stopped second. Provide the documents requested, then give the officer a chance to explain
why you were stopped. This will speed up the process. Remember, in most cases, the officer is
in uniform and is displaying a badge and name tag. You have the advantage of knowing with
whom you are dealing; the officer does not. Extend the courtesy by presenting the requested
paperwork promptly and without an argument.

•

Don’t argue the citation with the officer. If you think that the citation was wrongly issued, the
proper procedure is to request a hearing through the court system or attend the hearing for
which you received notification.

A roundabout is a large, circular area in the middle of an intersection meant to control the right-ofway of vehicles. It is a traffic management tool that moves traffic through an intersection without the
aid of traffic signals.
Entering traffic must yield the right-of-way to the traffic circulating within the roundabout. All traffic
moves in ONE DIRECTION around the roundabout – COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

How to Drive in a Roundabout
1. As you approach, choose which lane to use as you would for any other intersection.
2. Use the left lane to turn left, complete a U-turn, or to go straight. Use the right lane to turn
right or to go straight.
3. Yield. Those in the roundabout have the right-of-way. Wait for a gap in the traffic.
4. Decrease your speed to travel with the traffic already in the roundabout.
5. Use your right turn signal when exiting.

Trucks:
1. Drive on the circulatory roadway.
2. The exception is large commercial trucks
and trailers which are permitted to
use the truck apron provided around
the center island to negotiate the tight
turning radius. They drive (usually
with just the rear wheels) on the raised
pavement of the truck apron to navigate
more easily.
3. Cars should not use the truck apron.

Bicyclists:
1. If comfortable riding in traffic, take the
lane and circulate with the vehicles,
making sure to yield to traffic in the
circle when entering.
2. Ride at the speed of traffic in the
roundabout to discourage cars from
wanting to pass.
3. Use hand signals when exiting the
roundabout.
4. If you are unsure about using the
roundabout, dismount and walk your
bike in the designated crosswalks.

Pedestrians:
1. Always stay in the designated crosswalks.
2. Never cross to the central island.
3. Watch for cars. All pedestrians have the right-of-way, but always pay attention.

ignaling, Turning, Lane Changes, and Passing

Signaling
Using signals to tell others that you are going to change lanes, turn, slow down, stop or park is not
just common courtesy, it is also the law. Most vehicles have turn signal lights and brake lights as
required equipment. Hand and arm signals can also be used.
If the turn signals or brake lights on your car are temporarily out of order, you need to use the
following hand signals:
•
•
•

Left turn — Extend left arm horizontally out of open window
Right turn — Extend left arm with elbow bent upward at about a 90-degree angle
Slowing or stop — Extend left arm downward, with palm of hand to the rear

ABRUPTLY

To make safe and legal turns, drivers must:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Make sure the vehicle is in the correct lane well ahead of time.
Look ahead, behind, and to each side of your vehicle.
Be aware of other drivers and pedestrians.
Signal your turn at least 100 feet ahead (about 10 car lengths)
on city streets or 300 feet (30 car lengths) on open highways.
Watch for and obey traffic signals, signs, and pavement
markings that direct your movement.
Allow time and space to make your turn safely – slow down.
Yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic.
Steer through the turn and accelerate to the speed of traffic.
Be sure the turn signal is off after you enter the flow of traffic.

When turning right, you must be in the extreme right-hand travel lane or a lane designated for right
turns. If a single lane is provided to be used only for turning, you may only enter the lane if you are
making a right turn, and may not travel through an intersection while driving in the right-turn lane.
Turn into the right-hand lane of the roadway you are entering or the lane designated for the turn. If
you then need to change lanes, signal and proceed carefully to the next lane when you are well away
from the intersection.
When turning left, keep your wheels pointed straight ahead until you begin to actually complete the
turn. On a two-way road, use the lane just to the right of the center line and complete the turn into
the traffic lane closest to you going in your intended direction. Do not attempt to change lanes until
you can do so safely.

Many crashes are caused by drivers making turns. When turning, be especially aware of pedestrians
and bicyclists, as well as other vehicles. Before making your turn, look one more time in each direction.

45

Lane Changes
When you want to change lanes:
•
•
•
•

Use your rear and side-view mirrors to
check traffic
Signal ahead 100 feet (10 car lengths) on
city streets or 300 feet (30 car lengths) on
highways or freeways before changing lanes
Check blind spots by looking over your
shoulder and change lanes when traffic is
clear
Do not change lanes in an intersection

U-Turns
In Nevada, U-turns are generally allowed on any road when they can be made safely.
Legal U-Turns
A U-turn is turning your vehicle around in the street or intersection to go back the way you came. To
make a U-turn, signal and use the far left lane or the center left turn lane.
You may make a legal U-turn:
•
•
•
•

Across a double yellow line when it is safe and legal.
In a residential district when a traffic sign, light, or traffic signal light
protects you from approaching vehicles.
At an intersection on a green traffic signal light or green arrow,
unless a “No U-turn” sign is posted.
On a divided highway, only if an opening is provided in the center
divider.

Illegal U-Turns
Never make a U-turn:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

At or on a railroad crossing.
On a divided highway by crossing a dividing section, curb, strip of land, or two sets of double
yellow lines.
Where you cannot see clearly 200 feet in each direction because of a curve, hill, rain, fog, or
other reason.
Where a “No U-turn” sign is posted.
When other vehicles may hit you.
On a one-way street.
In front of a fire station. Never use a fire station driveway to turn your vehicle around.
In business districts. Areas with churches, apartments, multifamily housing units, and public
buildings are also considered to be business districts. Turn only at an intersection, unless a
sign prohibits it, or where openings are provided for turns.
Near a grade where there is less than 500 feet of visibility in both directions.

You should also be aware that local authorities and the Nevada Department of Transportation may
prohibit U-turns at any location within their respective jurisdictions.
Nevada law prohibits the operator of a vehicle from making a U-turn in a school zone except when
there are no children present, it is a day when no school is in session, on school days from half an
hour after schools ends to a half hour before the next school session begins or when the signs/lights
designate that the school zone is currently not in effect.

46

Passing Another Vehicle
Safe passing rules depend on the type of street or highway you are using. However, you should never
exceed the speed limit to pass and you may never use the shoulder of the road to pass.
Passing is not safe...
On two-lane roads
•

•

•

•

On two-lane roads where traffic moves in opposite directions,
you may pass on the left only when:
— You can see clearly ahead and there is no immediate
oncoming traffic;
— There is a broken yellow line on the highway or when the
broken yellow line is in your lane; and
— It is safe to do so.
When passing on a two-lane road, turn your left signal light
on 100 feet ahead in business or residential areas or 300 feet
ahead in other areas. After you have passed, pull back into
your lane when you can see the vehicle you passed in your
rear-view mirror.
You must not pass on a two-lane road:
— When coming to a curve or the top of a hill where you
cannot see far enough ahead to be sure it is safe;
— At or within 100 feet of a street crossing;
— At or within 100 feet of a railroad crossing;
— Where there is a double solid yellow line on the highway;
and
— Where signs prohibit passing.
When another vehicle comes up behind yours and signals
to pass, move to the right in your travel lane and let it pass.
Never speed up when another vehicle is passing you.

On multi-lane streets and highways
You may pass vehicles traveling in the same direction on the left if
there are no signs or highway markings that indicate passing is not allowed and it can be done safely.
Remember to signal, check your mirrors for traffic, and look over your shoulder before moving out of
your lane. Never pass to the left of a driver who is making or signaling a left turn.
While driving on a highway that has two lanes traveling in the same direction, it is illegal to travel in
the far left lane at a speed that is less than the posted speed limit and you are being overtaken in that
same lane from the rear by another vehicle that is traveling at a higher rate of speed. This rule does
not apply when:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Driving within a city or town
Preparing for a left turn at an intersection
Directed by law enforcement to drive in the far left lane
Operating an authorized emergency vehicle and performing official duties
Traffic conditions, weather or other hazards make it necessary to use the far left lane
Overtaking another vehicle traveling in the same direction.

You may pass on the right if the street or highway is clearly marked for two or more lanes of traffic
moving in the same direction you are, but only when passing is safe. Passing on the right is very
dangerous if the other driver does not see you and decides to change lanes. Again, remember to signal,
check your mirrors, and look over your shoulder to check your blind spots before you change lanes.
Never pass on the right when doing so would result in driving off the paved portion of the highway.

47

Passing Bicyclists
When passing a cyclist, a motorist must move into the lane to the left if more than one lane for traffic
in the same direction exists and doing so is reasonably safe.
If an adjacent lane does not exist, pass to the left of the bicycle at a safe distance, which must be at
least three feet. The motorist may not move back to the right until the vehicle is safely clear of the
bicycle. Traveling in a marked bicycle lane is prohibited.

Passing Parked Vehicles
•
•

•
•

P

If you are driving past parked vehicles, stay alert!
Watch for any sign that a vehicle may be pulling out in front of you, such as:
— Turn signal is on
— White backup lights are on
— Red brake lights are on
— Exhaust is coming from the tailpipe
Watch for pedestrians, bicyclists or skateboarders trying to cross between parked cars.
Watch for vehicle doors opening in front of or beside you.

arking

Here are some general rules about parking safely and legally.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Whenever you park and leave your vehicle, turn off the engine and set the parking (emergency)
brake.
Before opening your door to get out, look carefully for bicycles and other vehicles.
Be sure you have your keys, then lock your vehicle.
Your vehicle should face in the direction that normal traffic flows.
The legal parking position is with the front and rear wheels within 18 inches of the curb.
Your vehicle should be visible for 200 feet (about 20 car lengths) in each direction.
When a roadway has no curb or other barrier and there are no other signs or markings giving
instruction, you should park parallel to the road.
If you must stop on a highway:
— Park with all four wheels well off the pavement, if possible
— Leave enough space for other vehicles to pass safely
— Use your parking lights or four-way flashers if visibility is poor, or if it is between sunset
and sunrise
When you have to use emergency parking areas on highways and freeways, always use your
four-way flashers or parking lights.

Steering Wheel Locking Device — Never turn your vehicle’s ignition to the “lock” position while
it is still in motion. This will cause the steering to lock if you try to turn the steering wheel and
you will lose control of your vehicle.

Colored Curb Markings
Colored curb markings mean that parking is controlled as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
48

White usually indicates you are allowed a very short stop only to take on or
let off passengers, or to drop mail in a mailbox.
Green allows you to park for a limited time. The amount of time is usually
shown on a sign.
Yellow means a loading zone and rules depend on local laws.
Red means no stopping, standing or parking; local laws apply.
Blue designates handicapped parking areas.

Parallel Parking
Parallel parking areas are still common in many Nevada communities. Parallel parking is a driving
skill that requires both patience and practice. Here is how to park when there is only one space open
between two cars. This guide is for parking on the right side of the road. Use the opposite actions for
parking on the left side of the road.
1. As you approach the parking space, check the
traffic beside and behind you. If the driver behind
you is far enough away to stop or move around
you safely, use your turn signal to show you are
O □ lO ◄--·····•• ... mmm
preparing to park.
@
2. Make sure the space is big enough for your vehicle
(about 5 feet longer than your car). Pull up beside
the car parked immediately in front of your chosen
::.:....
f
space. Your car should be about 2 or 3 feet away
from the one beside you and your rear bumpers
should be lined up across from each other (see
@
Turn Wheels Right
picture A).
3. Shift to reverse, check your mirrors and look over
your shoulder for traffic behind and beside you.
Then slowly back up, turning the steering wheel all
the way to the right (see picture B).
4. When the back of your front seat is in line with the
@
Turn Wheels Left
rear bumper of the car you are parking behind,
straighten the wheels by steering smoothly and
◄mm•([
quickly to the left (see picture C). Keep your speed
slow. If you do not straighten your front wheels,
@
Turn Wheels Right
your right rear wheel will hit the curb. If you turn
your steering wheel too far to the left, your right
front fender may hit the car you are parking behind.
5. Continue to back up slowly until your front fender just clears the other car’s left bumper.
6. Looking over your right shoulder, back slowly, turning the steering wheel to the left and
stopping before your car touches the vehicle behind you.
7. Shift to drive. Move slowly forward, turn your steering wheel to the right to straighten the
wheels, and center your car in the space. You should be about 18 inches from the curb (see
picture D).
8. When you are correctly positioned, stop, shift to park (in an automatic transmission car) or
first gear or reverse (in a manual transmission car) and set the parking brake.

nternational Symbol of Access
This symbol that appears on reserved parking signs, placards and license
plates is the international symbol of access for persons with disabilities.
Parking spaces marked with this symbol may only be used when the person to
whom the valid disabled placard or license plate was issued is either operating
or being transported in the vehicle.
It is illegal for anyone else to park in spaces marked by this symbol. The
minimum fine for doing so is $250.

Courtesy Within the Community
If you are an individual who has been granted a placard for the purpose of occupying parking spaces
marked with the international symbol of access, please be mindful of spaces with loading zones. These
parking spaces may be needed by individuals with a higher degree of impairment, who require the
assistance of machinery, such as lifts, to exit and enter their vehicle.
Whenever feasible, please practice civility and use these parking spaces as little as possible.

ADVANCED DRIVER
ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are becoming increasingly common. These technologies
assist the driver but do not drive the vehicle by themselves. They are designed to enhance the safe
operation of the vehicle by helping drivers with certain tasks (e.g., staying in the lane, avoiding
crashes, reducing blind spots, and maintaining a safe space cushion).

V

ehicle Warning Systems Technologies

The primary purpose of these technologies is to provide
warnings to the driver in specific circumstances. Vehicle
warning systems technologies notify the driver with a
warning - by sound, light, or vibration - that a crash
is about to occur, or it provides an alert that there is a
problem or malfunction.
Most of these technologies are passive, meaning
they warn the driver of a potential issue but do not
automatically prevent a problem or crash. The driver may
need to make changes to the operation of the vehicle to
prevent a problem or crash.

Back-up Warning
When the driver shifts into reverse, sensors scan the area behind the vehicle. The back-up warning
will alert the driver through sounds, vibration, or both if there is an object behind the vehicle. The
driver should not become complacent and dependent on the back-up warning. The driver should safely
monitor and maneuver their vehicle during backing. These include checking side mirrors, rear-view
mirror, over the shoulder (head checks), and camera(s), if equipped.

Blind Spot Monitor and Warning
Blind spot monitors and warnings will warn the driver of other vehicles driving in their blind spots
through display of a symbol, sound, or vibration. They may provide additional warnings if the driver
uses their turn signal when there are other vehicles in another lane. The warnings provided by the
blind spot monitor can be activated when making a lane change. The driver should always check their
mirrors and look over their shoulders before changing lanes.

51

C

amera Technologies

Camera-based sensors help drivers and vehicles have a greater awareness of their surroundings,
making roads safer for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians.

Rear Camera
Engaging when the driver shifts into reverse, the rear camera activates to show the area behind the
vehicle. Depending on the vehicle, the display screen may be found on the center console, in the
rearview mirror, in the sun visor, or in other locations. The driver should not become complacent
and dependent on rear cameras. The driver must safely monitor and maneuver their vehicle during
backing maneuvers. These include checking side mirrors, rear-view mirrors, over the shoulders (head
checks), and camera(s), if equipped.

Sideview Camera
Sideview cameras show the driver an expanded view of a lane beside the vehicle when the driver
uses their turn signal or when the driver activates the feature manually. This feature has similar
uses to blind spot monitors. The feature shows the driver a video view of what is next to or coming
up alongside the vehicle. Sideview Cameras should be used in conjunction with traditional mirrors
and head checks (checking over the shoulders). Some newer vehicles may be equipped with sideview
cameras in place of traditional mirrors.

Surround-View Monitor or Around-View Monitor System
These systems help drivers park more easily by showing the vehicle’s surroundings through a virtual
bird’s-eye view above the vehicle, and show a moving image on their vehicle’s display monitor along
with parking lot lane markings, curbs, and adjacent vehicles. Some systems reinforce the visual
information with audio warnings if the driver is too close to an obstacle. In most vehicles, one camera
is in the middle of the front bumper, with two more cameras looking down from the side view mirrors
along the side of the vehicle.
Surround-View Monitor or Around-View Monitoring should be used in conjunction with traditional
mirrors and head checks (checking over the shoulders).

Curve Speed Warning
These systems help the driver maintain a safe speed when approaching a curve or exit. The vehicle
will alert the driver through sound, vibration, or both that they are approaching a curve or exit at an
unsafe speed.
The driver should not become complacent and dependent on curve speed warnings. The driver should
maintain a safe speed while driving and approaching curves or exits.

D

etection Technologies

These systems alert the driver when a bicycle, pedestrian, or slow-moving or stationary obstacle has
been detected while driving at low speeds - generally around 25 mph. Some systems can only detect
bicyclists, pedestrians, or obstacles when traveling directly in front of the vehicle and when moving in
the same direction. Some versions of obstacle detection will apply the vehicle’s brakes automatically.
Drivers should read the owner’s manual so they understand how they will be warned if the system
detects a bicyclist, pedestrian, or obstacle.
The driver may be alerted by beeps or the dashboard display. The beeps may become faster as the
vehicle moves closer to the obstacle. A collision may be imminent when the beeps become continuous.
52

The driver should not depend on bicycle, pedestrian, or obstacle detection. The driver should be aware
of their surroundings and check for bicyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles regularly - especially in
urban areas.

Forward Collision Warning Systems
These systems warn drivers of impending collisions with slower-moving or stationary vehicles or other
objects ahead of the vehicle so the driver can brake or swerve in time. The warning system alone will
not automatically brake for the driver. Forward Collision Warning scans the road ahead while driving.

High Speed Alert
High speed alerts will sound if the driver is speeding, helping drivers maintain a safe driving speed.

Lane Departure Warning Device
These devices warn a driver when they are drifting out of their lane using visual, vibratory, or sound
warnings. This feature can help alert a driver to steer back to the center of their lane if they mistakenly
drift, helping to prevent a crash.

Parking Sensors
These sensors alert the driver to the position of objects around the vehicle as they park. Listen for the
rate of the warning sounds; a constant tone means the vehicle is too close to an object.

Rear Cross-Traffic Alert
These systems alert the driver if one or more vehicles are about to enter the vehicle’s backing path.

D

river Assistance Systems Technologies

The primary purpose of these technologies is to perform a component of the driving function in
specific circumstances. Vehicle assistance systems technologies assist drivers in avoiding hazards and
crashes. Some automatically make adjustments to the vehicle, and some assist the driver in making
adjustments, such as braking or steering. The driver may still need to make changes to the operation
of the vehicle to prevent a problem or crash, but the vehicle assists.
It should be noted that the vehicle technologies may respond quicker than a human can react if
another vehicle or object appears suddenly in front of a vehicle without any warning. In the event
this happens during a practical driving examination, drive examiners will use their discretion when
deciding how such an interaction will be scored.

Driver Assistance Systems – Safety Critical Technologies
Safety critical technologies are technologies that may prevent or reduce the severity of a crash.

Automatic Emergency Braking Systems or Brake Assist
These systems sense slow or stopped traffic or objects ahead and will urgently apply the brakes if
the driver fails to respond. Drivers should continue to scan the road for hazards and maintain a safe
following distance.

Automatic Reverse Braking
These systems apply the brakes if an obstacle is detected while reversing the vehicle. If an object is
detected when backing up, the driver may hear a series of beeps or see visual indicators to alert them.
If the driver does not react, the brakes are immediately applied to help avoid a potential crash.
53

Lane Keeping Assist
Lane assistance systems return you to your lane if you drift out of it. The driver may receive an alert
via a sound, flashing light, or vibration if the vehicle drifts out of the lane. The driver should return
to their lane; if they do not act, this feature may gently steer the driver into their lane. It is easily
cancelled by nudging the wheel. This feature will not work when lane lines are faint or covered with
snow or dirt.

Left Turn Crash Avoidance
Monitors traffic when turning left across traffic at low speeds such as at a traffic light. It activates
warning sounds or dash lights and automatically applies the brake if the driver is turning left into the
path of another vehicle.
The left turn assist system monitors oncoming traffic when the driver initiates a turn maneuver across
the opposite driving lane at low speeds. If the gap in traffic is too small to permit a turn, the system
prevents the vehicle from moving forward. If a crash with an oncoming vehicle is imminent, the system
will stop the turning maneuver in time by initiating an automatic emergency braking maneuver.
The driver should not depend on left turn crash avoidance. The driver should safely scan and monitor
the driving environment ahead for hazards and determine when it is safe to turn in front of other
traffic.

Driver Assistance Systems – Convenience Technologies
The technologies listed below provide conveniences for the driver, do not require the applicant to
demonstrate a required skill set, and are not permitted during the testing process.

Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
Increases or decreases speed to maintain a following distance set by the driver. Advanced versions can
even slow and stop the vehicle in traffic jams and then accelerate automatically.
A driver should accelerate to their set speed and turn on the ACC. The driver can tell the ACC how
close the driver wants their following distance gap to be (generally short, medium, or long distances),
and it is then set to begin working. Sensors on the vehicle read the road ahead for traffic. However, the
driver is required to remain aware of their surroundings.
In bad weather and other unsafe driving conditions, it is advised not to use ACC.

Automatic Parallel Parking
Guides the driver into a parallel parking spot after searching and may find a viable option. The driver
is still responsible for braking and monitoring the environment.
The driver can activate the vehicle’s automatic parallel parking sensors when ready to park. The
system will inform the driver when it has found an appropriate spot to park. The driver should follow
any prompts provided by the vehicle’s automatic parallel parking feature. These may include pulling
in front of the space, shifting into reverse, and taking hands off the steering wheel. The driver is
responsible for braking.
After the vehicle is parked, the driver may need to do some slight adjustments to ensure the vehicle is
in an optimal position.

54

Autonomous Vehicles
“Autonomous Vehicle” means a motor vehicle that is equipped with an automated driving system
designed to function at a level of driving automation of level 3, 4, or 5 pursuant to the SAE J3016
standard. The term includes a fully autonomous vehicle. For additional information regarding
autonomous vehicles, see dmv.nv.gov/autonomous.htm. NRS 482A.030

Autonomous Vehicle Levels
The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed a classification system that defines the degree of
driving automation a car and its equipment may have to offer. The levels range from zero to five (0-5)
and start with vehicles without this technology and end with self-driving vehicles. More information is
available at sae.org/news/2019/01/sae-updates-j3016-automated-driving-graphic.

SPECIAL DRIVING CONDITIONS

A driver’s ability to adjust to different driving conditions is very important. Drivers also need to
recognize when conditions are too dangerous to risk driving at all.

N

ight Driving

Driving at night is always more difficult and hazardous than daytime driving. At night, you cannot see
as far, as soon, or as much. The glare from oncoming headlights also adds to the difficulty.
Drivers can make night driving safer in these ways:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Always make sure you can stop within the range of your headlights.
Keep your speed in control and within posted speed limits.
Do not look directly into the headlights of oncoming vehicles; look down and to the right side of
your lane.
Use the road edge line or center line for a guide.
Keep your windshield clean inside and out.
Never wear sunglasses when driving at night.
Pedestrians are difficult to see at night - be aware.

Headlights are legally required:
•
•
•
•

From a half hour after sunset until a half hour before sunrise.
When there is insufficient light.
Whenever persons or vehicles cannot be clearly seen at a distance of 1,000 feet.
When directed by an official traffic control device.

It is advisable to use your headlights when driving in rain, snow or fog. In addition:
•
•
•
•

Use high beams in open country at night. Change to low beams when you are at least 500 feet
before any oncoming vehicles and 300 feet before any vehicle you are following.
Drivers may flash the headlights to warn a driver ahead you intend to pass.
Keep headlights clean.
Drivers should not drive with just the parking lights on.

From 2015 to 2019, 276 fatal crashes occurred between the hours of 6:00 PM and 8:59 PM, totaling
19% of all fatal crashes. Nearly 35% took place at night in areas with street lighting.

Nevada’s weather is notoriously unpredictable. Sudden wind, rain, and snowstorms create especially
hazardous conditions. Winter driving in many parts of the state means using roads that may be icy or
snow-packed.
The most important thing to do when driving in bad weather is slow down. Stopping distances on
slippery roads may be 2 to 10 times greater than on dry pavement. If there is fog or it is raining or
snowing, drivers will not be able to see as well as they would normally. Remember that other drivers
will be having the same difficulties.
Give other drivers plenty of space and pay special attention to the tail lights on vehicles in front of you.
When driving on snow and ice:
•

Use all-weather radial tires, snow tires or chains. Even properly-equipped vehicles may slide on
ice or snow-packed roads.
Get the feel of the roadway; start out very slowly, then gently test your brakes to find out how
well you can stop. Start slowing down long before you come to an intersection or turn.
Keep a safe distance.
Reduce speed. There is no such thing as a completely safe speed on snow and ice. Each city
block or stretch of highway may be different, depending upon sun, shade, amount of sanding
and other conditions. “Never drive faster than you’d want to in a crash.”
Avoid sudden changes in speed or direction. In general, gentle braking (using a slow, light,
touch-and-release pattern) will allow you to slow down and stop safely. However, if your vehicle
has an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a firm, continuous pressure on the brake pedal is
needed to activate the anti-lock feature. Please refer to your vehicle owner’s manual.
Keep windows and windshield clear.
Allow yourself plenty of extra time to get to your destination.

•
•

Studded snow tires may only be used from October 1 through April 30. Tires with retractable
studs are allowed any time of year, but the studs may be extended or engaged only during the
dates indicated.

S

kidding

Skidding means your vehicle’s tires have lost traction. Skidding usually happens on ice or packed
snow, but it can also occur on wet pavement or gravel roads. Different types of braking and steering
systems, as well as vehicles with 4-wheel drive or front-wheel drive, respond in different ways. Please
consult your vehicle owner’s manual for specific information on skid recovery.

D

riving Emergencies

Safe handling of driving emergencies such as blowouts, brake failure, a stuck gas pedal, or near
misses with other vehicles requires special knowledge and skills.
Vehicle features and operating procedures vary greatly from one manufacturer to another. Your vehicle
owner’s manual is the best source for information on mechanical system failures. It is wise to take the
time to become familiar with your vehicle’s safety materials and specific features.
The following tips may help you deal with some situations. In all emergencies, stay calm and use
common sense.

57

Brakes Fail
Try pumping the brake pedal. If the brakes still do not respond:
•
•
•

Use the emergency parking brake.
If possible, shift to a lower gear. To prevent wear on the brakes, use a lower gear when you are
driving downhill for long stretches.
NEVER place the vehicle into “park.”

Wet Brakes
You should test your brakes after driving through deep water. They may pull to one side or not hold
at all. To dry the brakes, put your car in low gear, drive slowly and lightly apply the brakes. Test them
about every 200 feet, continuing until braking action returns to normal.

Windshield Wipers Fail
If the wipers fail in heavy rain or snow, slow down, lower the window and put your head outside so
you can see. If possible, move your car off the highway to the right and stop as soon as possible.

Accelerator (Gas Pedal) Sticks
Quickly press your foot hard against the pedal and release. This may free or release the pedal. If not:
•
•
•
•

Shift to neutral.
Apply the brakes.
Pull off the highway to the right (if possible) and stop.
NEVER place the vehicle into “park.”

Headlights Fail
Slow down and pull off the roadway as soon as you can. When headlights fail, your parking lights,
turn signals or four-way flashers will usually still work and can be used to guide you safely to the side
of the road.

Fire
If smoke comes from under the hood, slow down, pull off the road and turn off the ignition
immediately. Use extreme caution when opening the engine hood. If you do not have a chemical fire
extinguisher, you can smother a fire by using sand or dirt. DO NOT USE WATER because burning
gasoline will float on water and spread the fire. If you have no way to stop the fire or if it gets out of
control, move well away (at least 100 feet) from your vehicle.

Steering Fails
•
•
•

If you suddenly lose steering control, ease up on the accelerator.
If your car continues to hold the lane, slow down and then gently apply the brakes. Use your
four-way flashers to warn other drivers!
If your vehicle heads off the road or toward another vehicle or a pedestrian, apply the brakes
quickly using maximum pressure.

Oncoming Vehicle in Your Lane
If you see a vehicle coming toward you in your lane, slow down, sound your horn, flash your
headlights and pull as far to the right as you safely can. Do not swing into the lane the approaching
vehicle has left because the other driver may suddenly realize his or her mistake and turn back into
the proper lane.

58

Running Off the Pavement
Running off the highway can result in an extremely serious single-vehicle crash. This type of collision
accounts for a high number of fatalities in Nevada. Driver fatigue, inattention and speeding are all
major factors in these crashes.
If your vehicle drifts onto the shoulder or if you are forced off the road:
•
•
•
•

Stay calm.
Take your foot off the accelerator. If you brake, do so carefully.
Grip the steering wheel firmly.
Do not try to swerve back onto the pavement. Instead, stay on the shoulder until you have your
vehicle completely under control and gently ease back onto the road.

Blowouts
A blowout (when a tire suddenly loses air) can throw a vehicle out of control. Use the following tips for
safe recovery:
•
•
•
•
•

Grip the steering wheel firmly.
Ease up on the gas pedal to slow down. Do not hit the brakes!
Look for a safe place to pull off and signal your intent to move off the highway.
When you are sure your vehicle is under control and you have slowed down, gently use the
brakes to stop.
Make sure your vehicle is safely off the roadway and use parking lights or flashers to warn
other drivers.

Disabled Vehicle
•
•
•

T

If possible, get all four wheels off the roadway.
Use parking lights, flashers or flares to warn other drivers.
Have the vehicle towed as soon as possible.

ips for Driving in a Flash Flood

Nevada’s dry climate creates an ideal situation for flash flooding to occur, particularly during the
summer months. Drivers need to use extra caution when driving during a summer storm, spring thaw
or prolonged rains.
More than half of all flash flood fatalities are auto related. Here are some facts about flooding:
•

Less than 1 inch of water can cause a driver to lose control of his or her car.

•

Most vehicles can float in 2 feet of water or less.

•

Cars traveling at a high rate of speed can be pushed off the road by only 6 inches of water.

If you encounter a flooded roadway, don’t attempt to drive through it. Turn around and seek an
alternate route or wait until the water subsides. Although it may look like just a few inches of water
on the roadway, it is difficult to determine the depth of floodwaters. You have no idea if the road has
washed away underneath, causing a hazardous situation for drivers.
If your vehicle stalls in rising flood water and you can safely do so, abandon it immediately and seek
higher ground. Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away.
Once vehicles begin to float they move toward deep, faster-moving water where escape is even more
dangerous and top-heavy vehicles may roll over. Deaths often occur because people mistakenly believe
that vehicles provide protection from rising, swiftly moving waters.
59

If you find yourself in this situation, you must make a judgment call about whether you can make it to
higher ground or if you would be better off remaining with your vehicle. The only sure safety rule is to
turn around and avoid flooded roadways in the first place.
Additional guidelines:
•

Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers.

•

Avoid already flooded areas and areas subject to sudden flooding. Do not attempt to cross
flowing streams or water flowing over the roadway.

•

If you are driving and come upon rapidly rising waters, turn around and find another route.
Move to higher ground away from streams, creeks and flood control channels.

•

If your route is blocked by floodwaters or barricades, find another route. Barricades are put up
by local officials to protect people from unsafe roads. Never drive around them.

H

ighway Work Zones

Work zones are identified with orange signs, cones and barrels. Work zones are hazardous areas for
both workers and motorists. Stay alert. Lanes often narrow and the road is not smooth. Sometimes
cars must come to a complete stop. Use extra caution when approaching cars ahead since they may be
stopped. Flaggers and pilot cars are often used to control traffic. Do not move any barriers or signs to
cross over a road that is closed to traffic. Doing so is illegal and you will be subject to double penalties
for work-zone violations.
Fines for speeding double in work zones! Black and white speed limit signs are regulatory. Orange
speed limit signs are advisory and indicate slower, safer speeds. If time is a concern, consider another
route or start your trip earlier.
Visibility in a work zone may be reduced, especially at night. Be alert and do not drive when you are
tired. Watch for other drivers who may be sleepy.
•

Whenever you see orange signs, slow down and watch for equipment and people working on
the road.

•

Be aware of flaggers working to direct traffic and follow their instructions for everyone’s safety.

•

Merge carefully and cooperatively.

Traffic control in work zones provides additional safety for those who are working. It is also meant to
protect and reduce risks to motorists traveling through the work zone. For everyone’s sake, be careful,
obey the signs and arrive safely.

pproaching a Stopped Emergency Vehicle

Drivers in Nevada have certain duties when approaching stopped
emergency, utility, or service vehicles. Vehicles such as - but not limited
to - any law enforcement vehicle, tow truck, NDOT vehicle, garbage
truck, or any other vehicle displaying non-flashing blue lights in certain
circumstances. (NRS 484B.607)
This also applies to anyone attending to a repair of a vehicle.
In the absence of direction by a peace officer, the driver of a vehicle
approaching any of these vehicles must:
•

Decrease the vehicle speed to a speed that is reasonable and proper
and less than the posted speed limit.

•

Proceed with caution.

•

Be prepared to stop.

•

If possible, drive in a lane that is not adjacent to the lane in which
the emergency vehicle is stopped unless the roadway, traffic,
weather or other conditions make doing so unsafe or impossible.

When passing stopped
emergency, utility or
service vehicles, slow
to less than the posted
limit and if possible,
drive in a lane that is not
adjacent to the lane the
vehicle is stopped.

Emergency Vehicles on Highway Shoulders
Certain emergency vehicles may drive on the paved shoulder of a highway if signage placed along the
highway authorizes its use.
Drivers of non-emergency vehicles may not stop on a shoulder marked to allow emergency use.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Emergency vehicles which may use a paved shoulder include:
Authorized emergency vehicles such as law enforcement, fire engines and ambulances
Traffic incident management vehicles
Tow cars
Coroner vehicles
Public transit buses

Effective January 1, 2024. See AB 56 of the 2023 Nevada Legislature for more information. (NRS

C

SHARING THE ROAD

ommercial Vehicles

Over 200,000 crashes occur between cars and commercial vehicles each year. Many of these crashes
could be avoided by keeping these points in mind:
•
•
•
•
•

Large commercial vehicles cannot maneuver like a car or other smaller vehicles.
Large commercial vehicles have much larger blind spots than smaller vehicles.
Large commercial vehicles take more time and space to slow down or stop.
Most crashes between large commercial trucks and smaller cars are caused by the car drivers.
In commercial vehicle and small car crashes, the people in cars are much more likely to be
killed or injured than the driver of the commercial vehicle.

What is a No-Zone?
The “no-zone” is the area around large commercial trucks or buses where cars “disappear” into blind
spots. If truck drivers cannot see you, the possibility of a collision is greatly increased. These blind
spots are the side no-zone, rear no-zone and front no-zone areas. The right-side blind spot is doubly
dangerous because trucks and buses make wide right turns.

Side No-Zones
Do not “hang out” on either side of trucks or buses!
Trucks and buses have big no-zones (blind spots) on both sides. They are much larger than a car’s
blind spots. If you cannot see the driver’s face in the side view mirror, they cannot see you. If that
driver needs to swerve or change lanes for any reason, the chances of a collision are greatly increased.

62

Front No-Zones
Pass safely!
A driver can get “rear-ended” by a large commercial truck or bus if you cut in front too soon after
passing, then immediately slow down. This can force truck and bus drivers to slam on their brakes.
These large vehicles need nearly twice the time and distance to stop as cars. When passing, look for
the whole front of the commercial truck or bus in your rearview mirror before pulling into the truck’s
lane – and then do not slow down!

Rear No-Zones
Avoid tailgating!
Unlike cars, large commercial trucks and buses have huge no-zones directly behind them. The truck
or bus driver cannot see your car there, and you cannot see what is going on beyond the truck or bus.
If the truck or bus driver brakes or stops suddenly, you have no place to go and could end up running
into them.
Pay close attention!
Never pass behind a commercial truck that is backing up! Hundreds of motorists and pedestrians
are killed or injured each year by ignoring trucks that are backing up. The truck drivers cannot see
smaller vehicles or people directly behind their vehicles and may not see you cut in behind them.

Wide Right Turns
Avoid the “squeeze play”!
Large commercial truck and bus drivers sometimes need to swing wide to the left in order to safely
make a right turn or swing wide to the right to safely make a left turn. They cannot see cars directly
behind or beside them. Trying to “squeeze” between a commercial vehicle and the curb could be an
invitation to disaster!

M

otorcycles

Motorcyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers. However, there are special
situations and conditions we all need to be aware of to safely share the road.
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

Motorcycle operators have the right to use a complete traffic lane. Per NRS 486.351 (3),
“Motorcycles and mopeds may, with the consent of the drivers, be operated no more than two
abreast in a single traffic lane.” Without the consent of the driver, motorcycles couldn’t ride
side by side and would have to remain in a staggered formation.
Because of their smaller size, motorcycles are less visible and may appear to be farther away
than they really are.
It is difficult for other drivers to judge how fast a motorcycle is going.
Motorcycles may be forced from their position on the road by strong winds or a rough road
surface.
Turn signals are not self-canceling on most motorcycles. Before you make a lane change
or turn that depends on what path a motorcycle is taking, be sure you know what the
motorcyclist is doing.
Watch for clues, such as operators or passengers turning their heads to look behind or
operators beginning to lean or tilt their motorcycles.
If you are coming up behind a motorcycle, slow down sooner than you would for another
vehicle. Leave plenty of space.

63

•

•

Always dim your headlights when approaching a motorcycle. Because
motorcyclists use their balance to steer their vehicles, the blinding effect of
high beams can be far more dangerous to them than to drivers of cars or
large commercial trucks.
Bad weather and slippery roads can present real problems for
motorcyclists. Allow even more following distance when it is raining or the
road is slippery.

Motorcycle operators require a special endorsement to their Nevada driver’s
license. If you want additional information, please contact your local DMV office
and ask for a copy of the Motorcycle Handbook. You may also visit the DMV
website at dmv.nv.gov.

M

opeds

Mopeds, although similar, have a few key differences from motorcycles and electric bicycles. Nevada
defines these difference based on motor size, horsepower (maximum of two brake horsepower), and 30
miles per hour maximum speed on a flat or near-flat surface.
All the same precautions of driving - and driving near motorcycles - must be made around mopeds.
Moped operators have the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers. However, moped operators
have additional responsibilities based on the limitations of their vehicle. Moped operators must remain
in the extreme right-hand lane of any road unless:
•
•
•
•

There is a single lane of traffic
Preparing to make a left turn (turn must be made within one-quarter mile from entering lane)
When driving in the extreme right-hand lane would not be safe; or
Directed by a police officer

Moped owners must register their mopeds with the DMV but are not required to insure their vehicles.
Moped registration is a one-time fee to help prevent theft.
Moped operators and passengers are required to wear helmets in the State of Nevada.
For further information regarding mopeds, such as engine size, please visit the DMV website at
dmv.nv.gov/moped.

S

chool Buses

You are required to stop for school buses that are loading or unloading
students. NRS 484B.353 requires a driver to stop at any location for a
school bus displaying a flashing red signal. You may not attempt to overtake
or proceed past the school bus until the bus driver has turned off the
flashing red lights. There is one exception to this rule: on divided highways,
you are only required to stop when you are traveling in the same direction
as the school bus.
Nevada law allows school bus drivers to report violations to the school
district and the Department of Motor Vehicles. When this occurs, the
registered owner of the vehicle will be sent a warning letter explaining the
seriousness of the violation.

64

BOTH CARS
MUST STOP

B

icycles

The number of people using bicycles for transportation and recreation is increasing. Cyclists must
obey the same rules and regulations as other types of vehicles. The safe interaction between bicyclists
and motorists is the responsibility of both parties.
Motorists who cause even a minor collision with a bicycle or pedestrian or who intentionally interfere
with the movement of a bicycle may be charged with reckless driving. Penalties include a driver’s
license suspension. Bicyclists may not intentionally interfere with the movement of a motor vehicle.

Cyclists may ride in a traffic lane, staying as far to the right
as practicable unless preparing to turn or overtaking another
vehicle.
Cyclists must obey all traffic signs and signals. If a cyclist
chooses to cross an intersection in a crosswalk, they should
PLEASE~
dismount and cross as a pedestrian.
Cyclists must use hand signals to let others know what they
plan to do. The operator is required to give a hand signal one
IT'S THE LAW
time unless the bike is in a designated turn lane or if safe
operation requires the rider to keep both hands on the bicycle.
The cyclist may use their right arm to signal a right turn.
At intersections, motorists must yield to cyclists as they would for other vehicles and
pedestrians.
When passing a cyclist, a motorist must move to the left-hand lane if more than one lane is
available and doing so is reasonably safe.
If an adjacent lane does not exist, pass to the left of the bicycle at a safe distance (which must
be no fewer than three feet). The motorist may not move back to the right until the vehicle is
safely clear of the bicycle.
Motorists must yield the right-of-way to a cyclist on a bicycle path or in a bike lane.
Motorists may not stop, park or drive on a designated bicycle path or lane unless they are
entering or leaving an alley or driveway, performing official duties, are directed by a police
officer, or an emergency situation exists.
Inexperienced riders - especially children - require special courtesy and care. They may not
always follow traffic rules. Be especially careful around these riders and expect the unexpected.

P

assengers in the Bed of a Truck

P

edestrians

Anyone under the age of 18 may not ride on the bed of a flatbed truck or within the bed of a pickup
truck in Nevada if the truck is being driven on a paved highway. The exception to this is if you are
being driven in a parade authorized by a local authority or if the vehicle is being used while farming or
ranching.

Motorists must watch for pedestrians on streets and highways. Drivers should be especially careful
when children are present.
Motorists are required to exercise due care to avoid a collision with a pedestrian and pedestrians must
not place a motorist in a position which makes it impossible to avoid a collision. Motorists who cause
even a minor collision with a pedestrian may be charged with reckless driving.
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Drivers must exercise proper caution upon observing a pedestrian on or near a highway,
street, or road, and whenever traveling within or near a school zone or marked or unmarked
crosswalk. Pedestrians have the right-of-way when crossing at an intersection. Drivers are
obligated to yield to pedestrians who are attempting to cross the road.
It is illegal for motorists to overtake any vehicle that is slowing down or stopped until the
motorist slows down enough to determine why the other vehicle has slowed or stopped.
Be particularly aware and careful of pedestrians at intersections. Watch for pedestrians at stop
signs, traffic signals and around transit stops.
A crosswalk exists anywhere two streets intersect, even at a “T” intersection. A crosswalk
exists even if it is not painted or marked.
When a traffic signal turns green, drivers must yield to persons who are still crossing the
street. Pedestrians have the right of way over motorists making a right-hand turn.
If there is a sidewalk, pedestrians should use it. If there is no sidewalk, pedestrians should
walk on the side of the road facing the traffic.
Vehicles yielding to a pedestrian should wait until the pedestrian has crossed into the lanes
going in the other direction before proceeding.
The driver of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way, slow down or stop for a pedestrian crossing
the highway within a crosswalk when the pedestrian is upon the half of the highway upon
which the vehicle is traveling or onto which the vehicle is turning, or when the pedestrian is
approaching so closely from the opposite half of the highway as to be in danger.
If a crossing guard is present, motorists must wait until the guard is completely out of the
crosswalk before proceeding.

Safe Walking Tips
•
•
•
•
•

Use crosswalks. If the crosswalk has a signal, obey it.
A flashing “Don’t Walk” means do not cross. If a pedestrian in the intersection when a signal
starts flashing, they should finish crossing.
Before crossing, look left, right and left again for oncoming or turning traffic. Establish eye
contact with drivers who slow down or stop to ensure the driver is yielding the right-of-way to
you.
Whenever possible, wear brightly colored clothing to alert drivers to your presence.
If walking at night, carry a flashlight and use reflective materials to help drivers see you.

Remember – Courtesy and cooperation will greatly enhance pedestrian safety!

66

Pedestrians who are Blind or Visually Impaired
A person who is blind or visually impaired crossing a street on foot with a white cane or animal guide
is granted the right of way at all times on any highway, street, or road in Nevada. Any driver of a
vehicle who approaches or encounters such a person shall yield the right-of-way, come to a full stop, if
necessary, and take precautions before proceeding to avoid a crash or injury to the person.
(NRS 484B.290)
Here are some suggestions for helping pedestrians who are blind or visually impaired:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Don’t stop your car more than five feet from the crosswalk. A pedestrian who is blind or
visually impaired uses the sound of your engine as a guide.
Drivers of electric and hybrid vehicles must be extra alert to pedestrians who are blind or
visually impaired due to the nearly silent nature of these vehicles.
Don’t stop in the middle of a crosswalk.
Don’t honk your horn at a person who is blind or visually impaired.
Don’t give the pedestrian who is blind or visually impaired verbal directions.
Because they use the sounds of traffic, the pedestrian who is blind or visually impaired may
wait 3-4 seconds before they leave the sidewalk. Give them time to make that decision before
determining they are not going to cross.
If the pedestrian who is blind or visually impaired takes a step back and pulls in his or her
cane, it is an indication that they no longer intend to cross the street, and the driver may
proceed.
Do not turn right without looking first. Look for any pedestrians, especially pedestrians who
are blind or visually impaired, before starting your turn. Pedestrians who are blind or visually
impaired and have a green light are not expecting a driver to make a right turn in front of
them. A driver coming up from behind may not see the white cane.

TOWING

Non-commercial Class C drivers may tow a single vehicle or a combination of vehicles with a gross
vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less and a total length of no more than 70 feet.
This chapter is meant to provide Class C drivers some general information on towing. For further
information on towing or for those who wish to obtain a J endorsement, read the Nevada NonCommercial A and B, J Endorsement Study Guide. The study guide can be found on the DMV website
at dmv.nv.gov.

L

oading and Securing a Trailer

Loading a Trailer
This section talks about loading your trailer safely whether it is a travel trailer, fifth wheel, horse
trailer, or other type of trailer. All drivers must understand some basic loading safety rules. Loading a
trailer incorrectly can be a danger to others and to oneself. Other highway users can hit or be hit by
items that come loose, or the inside of your trailer can be damaged during a quick stop or crash.

Weight and Balance
It is important to know the weight and balance of your loaded trailer. Overloading can have negative
effects on steering, braking and speed control. Overloaded vehicles are likely to go very slowly on uphill
grades, and may gain too much speed on downhill grades. Stopping distance increases and brakes can
fail when forced to work too hard.
Here are some definitions of weight you should know:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

68

Gross vehicle weight (GVW) — The total weight of a single vehicle plus its load.
Gross combination weight (GCW) — The total weight of a powered unit plus trailer(s) plus the
load.
Gross combination weight rating (GCWR) — The weight specified by the manufacturer of a
vehicle as the combined loaded weight of that vehicle and a trailing vehicle.
Axle weight — The weight transmitted to the ground by one axle or one set of axles.
Tire load — The maximum safe weight a tire can carry at a specified pressure. This rating is
stated on the side of each tire.
Suspension systems — Suspension systems have a manufacturer’s weight capacity rating.
Coupling device capacity — Coupling devices are rated for the maximum weight they can pull
and/or carry.

Do not be top-heavy. The height of a vehicle’s center of gravity is very important for safe handling.
The higher the center of gravity (items piled up high or heavy items on top), the more likely it is to
overturn. It is very important to distribute the load or cargo so it is as low to the ground as possible.
Put the heaviest items under the lightest parts or in the lower storage compartments.
It is also important to balance the weight. Improper weight balance can make vehicle handling unsafe.
Too much weight on the steering axle can make steering difficult and cause damage to the steering
axle and tires. Under-loaded front axles (caused by shifting the weight too far to the rear) can make
the steering axle weight too light to steer safely. Also, too little weight on the driving axles can cause
poor traction and the drive wheels may spin easily. During bad weather, the vehicle may not be
able to maintain balance. If you have too much weight on one side of the trailer, the uneven weight
distribution could cause the trailer to overturn, especially on turns. Rolling over is also more likely in
turns or curves if you have to swerve to avoid a hazard. There are two things a driver can do to prevent
a rollover:
•
•

Go slowly around turns.
Keep the cargo as close to the ground as possible.

On flatbed trailers, there is also a greater chance that the load will shift to the side or fall off.

S

ecuring a Trailer

Ball-and-Hitch Coupler
Ball-and-hitch couplers are used on many types of trailers. This type of hitch is composed of a ball
attached to the towing vehicle and a coupler at the end of the tongue or A-frame assembly at the
front of the trailer. A load-distributing hitch is used for heavier models such as utility, boat and travel
trailers. Load-distributing hitches use special equipment to distribute the tongue load to all axles of
both the tow vehicle and the trailer. This helps stabilize the tow vehicle.
When hitching a trailer to a vehicle, make sure:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

All components of the ball-and-hitch coupling are present and not broken.
The trailer tongue is not bent, cracked or otherwise damaged.
The ball attachment is locked into the mounting attachment of the towing vehicle with the pin
and clip or other locking device.
The ball is seated firmly in the coupler.
The coupler safety latch is secured in the down position.
The safety chains are attached and crossed.
The electric lines are firmly seated and locked in place.
The safety chains and electric lines are not tangled, pinched or dragging.

Fifth-Wheel Hitch
This type of hitch is mounted to the bed of a truck and is used with a fifth-wheel trailer. The fifthwheel trailer has a kingpin at the end of the coupling unit on the front of the trailer. Because it is a
very stable assembly, balance and weight distribution issues are less likely to occur. A disadvantage
to this type of hitch is that it takes up most of the space in the bed of the truck and requires that the
remaining space behind the hitch assembly is kept clear for turning corners.
Before backing your vehicle under the trailer, make sure the trailer brakes are locked. It is important
to make sure the locking lever is locked after the jaws close around the kingpin. If the locking lever
is not locked, the coupling is not seated properly and should be fixed before driving the coupled unit.
Make sure the mounting assembly is not loose or missing any parts and the kingpin is not bent. The
mounting assembly must be solidly attached.

69

When hitching a fifth-wheel trailer to a vehicle, make sure:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The electric lines are not chafed, spliced, or worn.
The electric lines are connected and not tangled, pinched, or dragging.
The platform does not have cracks or breaks in the structure that supports the fifth-wheel skid
plate.
There is no space between the upper and lower fifth-wheel coupling.
The trailer is lying flat on the fifth-wheel skid plate.
The fifth-wheel plate is greased as required to prevent steering problems.
The release arm is in the engaged position and the safety latch is in place, if the fifth-wheel has
one. To unlock the fifth-wheel, pull the release handle to the open position.

Inspecting Your Trailer
As part of your pre-trip inspection, always check the following:
•
•
•

Prevent overloads or poorly balanced weight; ensure items are secured correctly.
Ensure all outside storage compartment doors are latched securely or locked.
Test the truck and trailer connection for security by gently pulling forward in low gear against
the locked trailer brakes and then looking at the connection. The electric lines and chains from
the car, truck, or RV to the trailer should be secure but allow enough slack for turns.

Inspect the trailer and the load-securing devices again within 50 miles after beginning an extended
trip. Make any needed adjustments and inspect again after you have driven for 3 hours or 150 miles.
It is also wise to inspect the trailer during every break you take throughout the drive.

owing Safely
Be Aware of Your Surroundings — To be a safe driver, you need to know what is happening
around your vehicle. A lack of awareness is a major cause of crashes.
Use Your Mirrors — It’s important to know what is going on behind and to the sides of your
vehicle. You need to use your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle. Check
your mirrors more often in special situations.
Signal Your Intentions — Other drivers can’t know what you are going to do until you tell them.
Signaling what you intend to do is not only important for safety; it’s the law.
Communicate Your Presence — Other drivers may not notice your vehicle even when it’s in plain
sight. Let them know you’re there to help prevent crashes.

Effect of Vehicle Weight on Stopping Distance
The heavier the vehicle, the more work the brakes must do to stop it and the more heat they absorb.
However, brakes, tires, springs, and shock absorbers on heavy vehicles are designed to work best
when the vehicle is fully loaded. Empty trucks actually require greater stopping distances because
they have less traction. Also, an empty truck can bounce and lock up its wheels, making it harder for
the brakes to work.

Managing Space
To be a safe driver, you need space all around your vehicle. When things go wrong, space gives the
driver time to think and to take action. To have space available when something goes wrong, drivers
need to manage their space. While this is true for all drivers, it is especially important for large
vehicles. They take up more space and require more space for stopping and turning.

70

Backing With a Trailer
Backing with a trailer is different than backing a single vehicle. When backing a single vehicle, turn
the top of the steering wheel toward the direction you want to go. When backing with a trailer, turn the
steering wheel in the opposite direction. Once the trailer starts to turn, you must turn the wheel the
other way to follow the trailer.
Because drivers cannot see everything behind their vehicle, backing up is always dangerous. Avoid
backing whenever you can. When you park, try to park so you will be able to pull forward when you
leave.
When backing up with a trailer, try to position your vehicle so you can back in a straight line. Here are
a few simple safety rules:
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Look at your path. Look at your line of travel before you begin. Get out and walk around the
vehicle. Check your clearance to the sides and overhead in and near the path your vehicle will
take.
Back slowly. Always back as slowly as possible. That way you can easily correct any steering
errors and stop quickly if necessary.
Use the mirrors. The mirrors will help you see whether the trailer is drifting to one side.
Correct drift immediately. As soon as you see the trailer getting off course, correct it by turning
the top of the steering wheel in the direction of the drift.
Use driver-side backing. Back and turn toward the driver’s side whenever possible, especially
on a curved path. Backing toward the right side is very dangerous because you can’t see as
well. If you back and turn toward the driver’s side, watch the rear of your vehicle by looking out
the side window. Use driver-side backing even if it means going around the block to put your
vehicle in this position. The added safety is worth it.
Pull forward. When backing a trailer, pull forward to reposition your vehicle as needed.
Use a helper. Try to use a helper – they can see places where you have blind spots. The helper
should stand near the back of your vehicle where you can see them. Before you begin backing,
work out a set of hand signals that you both understand. Agree on a signal for “STOP.”

Right Turns
Here are some rules to help prevent right-turn crashes:
•
•
•
•

Turn slowly to give yourself and others more time to avoid problems.
If driving a vehicle that cannot make the right turn without swinging into another lane, turn
wide as you complete the turn. Keep the rear of your trailer close to the curb. This will stop
other drivers from passing you on the right (see Figure 1 below).
Don’t turn wide to the left as you start the turn. A following driver may think you are turning
left and try to pass you on the right. You could crash into the other vehicle as you complete
your turn (see Figure 2 below).
If you must cross into oncoming traffic to make a turn, watch out for vehicles coming toward
you. Give them room to go by or stop. However, don’t back up for them because you might hit
someone behind you.

71

Left Turns
On a left turn, make sure you have reached the center of the intersection
before you start the turn. If you turn too soon, the left side of your vehicle
may hit another vehicle due to off-tracking (when a vehicle or trailer drifts
into another lane unintentionally).
If there are two turning lanes, always take the right hand turn lane. Do not
start in the inside lane because you may have to swing right to make the
turn. Drivers on your right may be hard for you to see. You may crash into
them.

Space Needed to Cross or Enter Traffic
Be aware of the size and weight of your vehicle when you are crossing or entering traffic. Here are
some important things to keep in mind:
•
•
•

Because of slow acceleration and the space large vehicles require, you may need a much larger
gap to enter traffic than you would in a car.
Acceleration varies with the load. Allow more room if your vehicle is heavily loaded.
Before you start across a road, make sure you can get all the way across before traffic reaches
you.

Space Overhead
Hitting overhead objects is a danger. Make sure you always have sufficient overhead clearance.
•
•
•
•
•

Do not assume that the height posted at bridges and overpasses is correct. Repaving or packed
snow may have reduced the clearances since the height was posted.
The weight of a vehicle changes its height. An empty trailer is higher than a loaded one. A
bridge where you had clearance with a loaded vehicle may be too low for your vehicle when it is
empty.
If you doubt you have enough space to pass under an object, go slowly. If you are not sure
you can make it, take another route. Warnings may or may not be posted on low bridges or
underpasses.
Some roads can cause a vehicle to tilt. There can be a problem clearing objects along the edge
of the road, such as signs or trees. Where this is a problem, drive a little closer to the center of
the road.
Before you back into an area, get out and check for overhanging objects, such as trees,
branches, or electric wires. It’s easy to miss seeing them while you are backing. Check for other
hazards at the same time.

Space Underneath
Many drivers forget about the space under their vehicles. That space can be very small when a vehicle
is heavily loaded. Railroad tracks can stick up several inches. This is often a problem on dirt roads
and in unpaved yards where the surface around the tracks can wear away. Don’t take a chance on
getting hung up halfway across. Drainage channels across roads can cause the end of some vehicles to
drag. Cross such depressions carefully.

72

T

owing Multiple Vehicles

Combination of Vehicles
Combinations of vehicles are usually heavier, longer, and require more driving skills than single
vehicles or truck/trailer combinations. This means that drivers of combinations of vehicles need more
knowledge and skill than drivers of single vehicles. This section includes some important safety factors
that apply specifically to combinations of vehicles.
When towing a combination of vehicles, the heaviest vehicle must always be in the first position
behind the towing vehicle. The lighter vehicle should be in the rear.
Vehicles with trailers have a dangerous “crack-the-whip” effect which increases with multiple trailers.
When you make a quick lane change, the crack-the-whip effect can turn a trailer over. There are many
crashes where only the trailer has overturned.
“Rearward amplification” causes the crack-the-whip effect. The figure below shows eight types of
combination vehicles and the rearward amplification each has in a quick lane change. Rigs with the
least crack-the-whip effect are shown at the top and those with the most are at the bottom. Rearward
amplification of 2.0 in the chart means the rear trailer is twice as likely to turn over as the truck.
Triples have a rearward amplification of 3.5, which means the last trailer of a triple can roll 3.5 times
as easily.
Steer gently and smoothly when pulling trailers. Trailers flip over from quick steering moves more
easily than many vehicles.

Brake Early
Line of Travel

Direction of Slide
Rear Tractor Wheels
Locked-up or Spinning

Control your speed whether fully loaded or empty. Large
combination vehicles that are empty take longer to stop than
when they are fully loaded. When lightly loaded, the very stiff
suspension springs and strong brakes give poor traction and
make it very easy to lock up the wheels. Your trailer can swing
out and strike other vehicles. Your vehicle can jackknife very
quickly (see picture to the left).
In any combination rig, allow a lot of following distance and
look far enough ahead so you can brake early. Don’t be caught
by surprise and have to make a “panic” stop.

Prevent Trailer Skids
When the wheels of a trailer lock up, the trailer will tend to
swing around. This is more likely to happen when the trailer
is empty or lightly loaded. This type of action is often called a
“trailer jackknife” (see picture at right).

Line of Travel

♦

Recognizing a Skid
The earliest and best way to recognize that the trailer has
started to skid is by seeing it in your mirrors. Any time the
brakes are applied hard, check the mirrors to make sure the
trailer is staying where it should. Once the trailer swings out of
your lane, it is very difficult to prevent a jackknife.

Stop Using the Brake
Release the brakes to get traction back. Do not use the trailer
hand brake (if there is one) to straighten out the rig. This is the
wrong thing to do, since the brakes on the trailer wheels caused
the skid in the first place. Once the trailer wheels grip the road
again, the trailer will start to follow the vehicle and straighten
out.

INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY

In Nevada, all motorists must comply with mandatory insurance and financial responsibility laws.
Nevada law establishes minimum amounts of liability insurance that drivers must carry when they
drive or own a vehicle in this state. An Evidence of Insurance Card furnished by the company must
be carried in the vehicle or be available in an electronic format that can be displayed on a mobile
electronic device.
The state of Nevada requires that all registered motor vehicles be covered by liability insurance.
The minimum coverage is $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person in any one crash; $50,000
for bodily injury or death of two or more persons in any one crash; and $20,000 for injury to or
destruction of property of others in any one crash.
The DMV has established a Nevada Liability Insurance Validation Electronically (NV LIVE) program
to identify uninsured motorists and enhance public safety. Through the use of computer programs
in partnership with licensed Nevada insurance companies, the DMV has been very successful in
identifying registration records where insurance has been terminated or had a lapse in coverage.
If a registration is suspended for a lapse of insurance and no new coverage for that time frame has
been obtained, the driver will be required to pay a reinstatement fee and applicable fines (starting
at $250 and totaling up to $1,750) for each registered vehicle covered by that insurance. Additional
penalties may include an SR-22 and/or a 30-day suspension of a driver’s license.
Financial responsibility laws also apply to crashes and include the following provisions:
•
•

If you are in a crash that is investigated by law enforcement, your insurance information and a
description of damages or injuries will be sent to the DMV by the investigating officer.
If you are in a crash that is not investigated by law enforcement and the crash causes $750 or
more in damages or anyone is injured, you must complete and send a Report of Crash Form
(SR-1) within 10 days to:
Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles
Central Services Division — Financial Responsibility Section
555 Wright Way
Carson City, NV 89711-0400

•
•

You must complete the crash report form (SR-1) if you are either the driver or the registered
owner of the vehicle.
You can get a report form from any DMV office, the Nevada Highway Patrol, a local law
enforcement agency or the DMV website at dmv.nv.gov.

75

•

•

For any crash, the DMV Financial Responsibility Section determines:
— Who was at fault
— If all vehicles or drivers were insured
— The total amount of liability
If you are at fault and do not have liability insurance:
— Your driver license and/or vehicle registration may be suspended;
— You will have to post a deposit with the DMV to cover the costs of the crash; or
— You must make arrangements with the other parties to pay for damages or injuries.

If you do not report a crash to the Department of Motor Vehicles, your driver license and/or your vehicle
registration may be suspended.

SR-22 Insurance: Proof of Financial Responsibility
Some drivers may be required to file an SR-22 form as a condition of reinstatement. SR-22 is a form
of liability insurance on a driver license that allows the Department to monitor the insurance of a
suspended and/or revoked driver record through information received from the driver’s insurance
company. The cost of this insurance is dependent upon the structure of the insurance company.
The period of coverage begins when you actually reinstate it. You need to file this form only once. Do
not purchase SR-22 coverage until you have met all other reinstatement requirements and are ready
to apply for your license.
For more information regarding financial responsibility laws, please call or email the DMV.

What to Do in a Crash
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

76

Stop.
Get medical help for the injured.
Warn traffic.
Notify law enforcement.
Fender bender? Move to the shoulder. If there is only damage to a vehicle or other property (no
injuries) and the vehicle can be moved safely, move to a location that does not obstruct traffic
and return to the scene.
Exchange your name, address, driver license number, registration, and insurance information
with other drivers involved.
If the crash involves an unattended vehicle or other property, you must give the owner your
name, address, driver license number, registration and insurance information, either in person
or by leaving a note.

9

YOUR DRIVING RECORD

In Nevada, getting a driver license is a privilege. Once you have your license, you need to continue
to drive safely, obey the rules and respect the rights of other drivers. If you do not, your license may be
suspended, revoked, or canceled.
Information about traffic crashes and convictions becomes part of your driving record. Even traffic
violations that occur in other states are added to your Nevada driving record.
Most violations are reportable to your insurance company for three years. Convictions related to DUI
(Driving Under the Influence) stay on your record for seven years.

D

emerit Point System

The DMV uses a demerit point system as part of its driver improvement program. All traffic law
violations are assigned a point value. When the DMV receives a conviction notice or civil infraction
from a court, the offense is entered on your driver record and points are assigned. Demerit points are
counted during a 12-month period.
•
•
•

If you receive 12 or more points in any 12-month period, your license will be suspended.
If you have accumulated between three and 11 points, you may have three points removed
by completing a traffic safety course at a school approved by the DMV. You may attend traffic
school only once in a 12-month period to remove points from your record.
Attending traffic safety school removes a maximum of three demerit points. Points will be
removed when the school reports completion for credit. However, the record of the conviction
remains part of your driving history.

A conviction of a major traffic offense, such as DUI or causing substantial bodily harm, will
result in your license being revoked. These offenses are not assigned demerit points.
The DMV will notify you if your license status is in jeopardy due to unsafe driving habits.

77

The following is a partial list of traffic violations and demerit points that can be assigned to your
driving record:
Reckless driving ............................................................................................ 8
Careless driving ............................................................................................ 6
Failure to give information or render aid at the scene of a crash .................... 6
Following too closely...................................................................................... 4
Failure to yield right-of-way........................................................................... 4
Failure to yield to a pedestrian ...................................................................... 4
Disobeying traffic signal or stop sign ............................................................. 4
Impeding traffic, driving too slowly ................................................................ 2
Failure to dim headlights .............................................................................. 2

Speeding
1-10 mph over posted limit............................................................................ 1
11-20 mph over posted limit.......................................................................... 2
21-30 mph over posted limit.......................................................................... 3
31-40 mph or more over posted limit............................................................. 4
41 mph or more over the posted speed limit .................................................. 5
Prima Facie speed violation or driving too fast for the conditions ................... 2
If you have a Commercial Driver License, there are additional penalties for some traffic
violations and additional demerit points may be assigned.

It is against the law to give false information when applying for your Nevada driver license. It
is also illegal to alter your license in any way, lend it to someone else or use another person’s
license.

DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE

Alcohol is an intoxicating beverage that, when consumed, can slow brain functions, affect information
processing and delay hand-eye coordination. Combining alcohol with driving, especially over the legal
limit of .08, can increase the likelihood of a crash from 5 times up to 30 times (2015 NHTSA study). In
2016, alcohol-related crashes were a factor in over 31% of Nevada’s roadway fatalities.
Drugs are generally defined as a substance in medicine or any substance used in the creation of
medicine. The term “drug” can also mean an illegal substance whose production or use is prohibited
or strictly controlled by prescription. Both types of drugs can greatly affect motor skills and impair a
driver’s ability to think and react. Drivers should not attempt to drive if under the influence of such
drugs.
With the legalization of marijuana in Nevada, it is still unlawful for any person to drive or be in
actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway or on premises to which the public has access with
an amount of marijuana or in their system greater than two nanograms per milliliter of blood (five
nanograms per milliliter of blood for marijuana metabolite).
From 2012 to 2015, alcohol and drugs contributed to 4,651 total injury crashes, 7,022 non-serious
injuries in a crash, and 445 serious injury crashes in the State of Nevada.
Nevada laws on driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs are tough. Under these laws,
there are two types of penalties:
•
•

Administrative: Action taken against a driver by the Nevada DMV regardless of the court
findings
Criminal: Action taken by the court system

Under Nevada’s Implied Consent Law, if an officer suspects you are driving under the influence, you
will be asked to take blood, breath or urine tests. If you fail to submit to these tests, your license,
permit or privilege to drive will be revoked pursuant to NRS 484C.220 and you will not be eligible for a
license, permit or privilege to drive for a period of one year for first offense or three years if your driving
privilege has been revoked in the prior seven years for failure to submit to the officer-directed tests. An
officer may also direct that blood samples be drawn, even on a first offense.
Under Nevada’s Illegal Per Se Law, if chemical tests show an alcohol concentration of .08% or more
or any detectable amount of a controlled substance, your driving privilege will be revoked. If you are
under the age of 21 and a chemical test shows an alcohol concentration of .02%, but less than .08%,
your driving privilege will be suspended. This is an administrative penalty and the officer can take
your license immediately.
Even though an alcohol concentration of .08% is used as a guide, you can be arrested and
convicted with a lower level.
Anytime you lose your license, you can ask for an administrative hearing through the DMV.

commercial driving.
The driving privileges of DUI offenders can be immediately reinstated if a driver license with
an ignition interlock restriction is issued and an ignition interlock device is installed in any
vehicle the motorist operates at his or her own expense.
80

D

UI Laws for Young Drivers

Tough DUI laws also apply to young drivers. A licensed driver under the age of 18 found by juvenile
court to have been driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance will have his or her
license suspended for 185 days.
A driver under the age of 18 who is found by juvenile court to have been driving under the influence,
or a driver under the age of 21 who is convicted of a DUI, will be required by the court to undergo
evaluation for alcohol or drug abuse. Based on the evaluation report, the judge may order alcohol or
drug treatment for the offender.
Young drivers are subject to the same 185-day license revocation period and reinstatement
options as drivers over the age of 18. See the ignition interlock information on the previous
page.

O

ther DUI Laws

Nevada’s open container law makes it illegal to have alcoholic beverages which have been opened in
the driver or passenger areas when a vehicle is being driven. It does not apply to the living quarters of
motor homes or house trailers, or to the passenger areas of commercial buses, limousines or taxis.
If you are found guilty of a DUI offense and you had passengers under the age of 15 in the vehicle you
were driving, the court will consider that as an aggravating factor in determining your sentence.
If you plead guilty or are found guilty of DUI (alcohol or drugs) and a chemical test was conducted, the
court will impose an additional $60 fine to cover the costs of the chemical analysis.

C

lues that a Driver May Be Under the Influence or Impaired

see a driver doing any of the following, watch out! These are all clues to driving under the influence of
alcohol or drugs:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Making a turn too widely
Using two lanes, straddling the center line
Almost hitting someone or something
Weaving or drifting from one side of the lane or road to
another
Driving off the road or going straight through turn lanes
Driving too slowly for the speed limit and traffic conditions
Stopping in traffic without a reason
Following too closely
Driving with the tires on the lane markers or center line
Erratic braking (riding the brakes, using brakes for no
reason or braking in an uneven, jerky way)
Driving into oncoming traffic

NEW RESIDENT VEHICLE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS

Drivers must register their vehicles within 30 days of establishing residency in Nevada or at the time
they obtain a driver license, whichever occurs earlier.

Required Original Documents
•
•
•
•
•
•

Most recent registration certificate
Out-of-state license plates
Nevada Evidence of Insurance card
Nevada Emissions Vehicle Inspection Report (smog check) in certain areas of Clark and Washoe
counties. For exempt areas, please refer to NAC 445B.593 and 445B.594.
Nevada Vehicle Identification Number Inspection Certificate (completed at a DMV office, any
authorized DMV agency or by a law enforcement officer)
Certificate of Ownership/Title unless held by a lienholder. If ownership is not changing, the
owner has the option of retaining the out-of-state title.

The full legal name must match on the registration, ownership/title certificate and evidence of
insurance.

Liability Insurance Information

Out-of-state insurance is not accepted. You must either notify your insurance carrier that you have
moved or purchase a new policy in Nevada. The state of Nevada requires that all vehicles actively
registered be continually insured by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state. An
Evidence of Insurance Card furnished by the company must be carried in the vehicle at all times.
Nevada law requires coverage in amounts of at least:
• $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person;
• $50,000 for bodily injury or death of two or more persons; and
• $20,000 for injury or destruction of property of others.
If a driver cancels their Nevada insurance and does not obtain new insurance, they must cancel their
