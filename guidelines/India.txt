CHAPTER 1 | Obtaining a New Credential

CHAPTER ONE | OBTAINING A NEW CREDENTIAL
CREDENTIAL OVERVIEW
The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) issues three types of credentials, as outlined below:
1.

Identification Cards
These are available to any qualified Indiana resident. Identification cards are issued at no cost to
individuals who are or will be 18 years of age on or before the next General or Municipal Election.

2. Learner’s Permits
This category includes a driver learner’s permit (herein referred to as learner’s
permit), motorcycle learner’s permit, and a commercial learner’s permit.
3. Driver’s Licenses
This category includes a driver’s license and commercial driver’s license (CDL).
All credentials issued to Indiana residents who are under 21 years of age have a vertical format
and display the dates the card-holder turns 18 and 21 years of age. A star marker appears in
the upper right-hand corner to indicate that a credential is Real ID-compliant and may be used
as identification for federal purposes. (See below for more information about Real ID)

CREDENTIAL DESIGN
In 2019 Indiana began issuing credentials with a new look and security features. Current credentials
will remain valid until the expiration date printed on the face of the card. Indiana credentials
have embedded security features that allow law enforcement to determine their authenticity.
All credential applications are processed through intensive security checks to help prevent
identity theft and fraud. If during verification, the BMV discovers another credential has been
issued to an applicant in another state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District
of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the applicant will be required to surrender the
out-of-state credential before the BMV will process an application for an Indiana credential.

As of December 2022, The Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have
established May 7, 2025, as the deadline for when they will
begin requiring those boarding an aircraft using a driver’s license
or identification card to have a Real ID-compliant credential.
Please visit the DHS website at DHS.gov for the most updated
information. The Indiana BMV recommends that all citizens apply
for a Real ID during their next renewal or before if their current
credential expires after the May 7, 2025 deadline. To upgrade

The Real ID Act of 2005 established minimum standards for
state-issued credentials. As a reminder, credentials include
driver’s license, permits, and identification cards. State-issued
credentials that meet these standards can be accepted for
federal identification, including boarding commercial flights,
entering military, and other secure federal facilities. The purpose
of these standards is to set uniform documentation and imagecapture requirements, prevent fraud, and generate credentials for
printing and mailing from a secure centralized facility. Indiana has
been compliant with the Real ID Act requirements since January
1, 2010, so federal enforcement has not affected our citizens
who have since been issued a Real ID-compliant credential.

CHAPTER 1 | Obtaining a New Credential

If You Are Younger than 18 Years of Age
If you are under 18, but more than 16 years and 180 days old, and have held a valid out-ofstate driver’s license for at least 180 days in your previous state(s) of residency, you must visit a
BMV branch to present your current out-of-state driver’s license or a copy of your official driving

Î For additional endorsement and restriction requirements, please refer to Chapter 2 of this manual.

APPLYING FOR AN IDENTIFICATION CARD
Identification cards may be issued to an Indiana resident of any age who does not have a
driver’s license. Indiana residents cannot hold more than one credential at the same time, even
if one of the credentials was issued by another state. Therefore, you must surrender any other
credential to the Indiana BMV in order to complete an application for an identification card.
Identification cards may also provide privileges to operate a Motor Driven Cycle
(MDC – endorsement B) as long as you are at least 15 years of age and pass an
MDC knowledge exam. If both requirements are met, an MDC endorsement will
be placed on your identification card to signify your operating authority.
To apply for an identification card, you must visit a BMV branch and present
documents described in Appendix A proving your identity, lawful status, Social Security
number (unless you are claiming an exemption or you are a foreign national, both
of which require alternative documentation), and Indiana residency.

Identification Card Validity

• An identification card and an MDC endorsement are valid for six years
• Identification cards issued to lawful temporary residents expire on the applicant’s
end of stay date so may not reflect standard periods of validity

LE ARNER’S PERMITS
A learner’s permit allows an Indiana resident to practice driving before applying for a
driver’s license. You may apply for a learner’s permit at any BMV branch.
If you are 16 years of age or older, you must meet the following
requirements to obtain a learner’s permit:
• Present documents described in Appendix A proving your identity, lawful
status, Social Security number (unless you are a foreign national, which

If you are under 16 years of age and are enrolled in a driver education program:
• You may drive only when you are accompanied by a licensed driver training
instructor or a certified driver rehabilitation specialist who is both recognized by
the BMV and employed through a driver rehabilitation program. The instructor or
rehabilitation specialist must be seated in the vehicle’s front passenger seat.
• You may also practice driving with a licensed driver who has valid (not expired,
suspended, or revoked) driving privileges and is 25 years of age or older. The licensed
driver must be related to you by blood, marriage, or legal status. You may also choose
to practice driving with your spouse, who must be licensed and at least 21 years of
age. The licensed driver must be seated in your vehicle’s front passenger seat.
If you are under 18 years of age and you are not enrolled in a driver education program:
• You may practice driving with a licensed driver who has valid (not expired, suspended,
or revoked) driving privileges and is 25 years of age or older. The licensed driver
must be related to you by blood, marriage, or legal status. You may also choose to
practice driving with your spouse, who must be licensed and at least 21 years of
age. The licensed driver must be seated in your vehicle’s front passenger seat.
• You may also practice driving with a learner’s permit if accompanied by an individual
licensed as a driver training school instructor who is working under the direction of a
driver training school, or a certified driver rehabilitation specialist who is recognized by
the Indiana BMV and employed through a driver rehabilitation program. The instructor
or rehabilitation specialist must be seated in your vehicle’s front passenger seat.

If you are under 18 years of age and are under the care and supervision of the
Department of Child Services:
• You may practice driving with a licensed driver who has valid (not expired,
suspended, or revoked) driving privileges and is 25 years of age or older. The

age, or with your spouse provided he or she is licensed and at least 21 years of age or older.

Learner’s Permit Validity

1.

Learner’s permits are valid for two years from the date of issuance.

2. Learner’s permits issued to lawful temporary residents expire on the applicant’s
end of stay date so may not reflect standard periods of validity.
3. If you are visiting a BMV branch to renew your learner’s permit and it has
been expired more than 180 days, you are required to retest.

VISION SCREENING
All Indiana learner’s permit or driver’s license applicants are required to pass a
vision screening, even if the applicant is renewing an existing learner’s permit
or driver’s license, unless the applicant is eligible for online renewal.
If you normally wear glasses or contacts while driving, you should inform the BMV branch personnel
and wear them during the vision screening. If your visual ability does not meet state standards, you will
be required to visit an eye doctor for an examination. If you return to the BMV branch with a statement
from an eye doctor affirming that your vision has been corrected to meet the state standard, you may
continue the driver’s license application process, which will include a vision screening at the BMV branch.

CHAPTER 1 | Obtaining a New Credential

KNOWLEDGE E X AM
The driver’s knowledge exam is a multiple-choice exam based on Indiana law, defensive driving
practices, and information contained in this driver’s manual. Passing the driver’s knowledge exam
is one step in the process of obtaining driving privileges in Indiana. To pass the knowledge exam,
you must demonstrate a basic understanding of Indiana traffic laws and safe driving techniques.
You must also be able to read and understand regulatory, warning, and traffic signs and signals.
The driver’s knowledge exam is required for the following:
• Learner’s permit applications
• A new Indiana resident whose out of state driver’s license is expired
or a new resident with a valid out-of-country license
• An Indiana resident whose driver’s license has been expired for more than 180 days
• A driver who has six or more active points on an Indiana driving
record and is renewing their driver’s license
• Active duty military personnel, their spouse, and/or dependents, if applicable, whose
Indiana driver’s license has been expired for more than 180 days and who has
returned from deployment more than 90 days prior to the date of renewal
• Out-of-state active duty military service member whose driver’s license has been
expired more than their old state of record’s allowed military extension
The Indiana BMV also offers knowledge exams for CDL applicants who choose
to add operational-specific endorsements, and applicants who wish to operate
motorcycles, MDC – Class B vehicles, and in a for-hire capacity.
Î You must arrive at the branch at least one hour before the branch closes to take the
knowledge exam that day.
Î If you fail the knowledge exam, you must wait until the next business day to retake it.

DRIVING SKILLS E X AM
If you have a learner’s permit and attend a BMV licensed driver training school that participates
in the BMV’s driving skills test program, you may take the driving skills exam with the school
after successful completion of the course, which includes 30 hours of theoretical training
and six hours of behind-the-wheel training. If you successfully complete a driving skills exam
administered by the driver training school, the results of your exam will remain valid until your
learner’s permit expires. A list of licensed driver training schools is available at IN.gov/BMV.
You must take the driving skills exam at a BMV branch if any of the following situations occur:
• Your learner’s permit expires
• You receive a failing grade in either portion of the driver education course
• Your driver training school does not participate in the driving skills test program for the driving skills exam
If your learner’s permit expires and it has been more than 180 days since your last
knowledge exam, you will need to retake the knowledge exam to be issued a renewed
learner’s permit. The period of time you hold a valid (not expired, suspended, or
revoked) learner’s permit will count toward the required 180-day holding period.
To schedule an appointment for a driving skills exam, visit IN.gov/BMV or call the BMV Contact
Center at (888) 692-6841. A driving skills exam may be scheduled no more than three weeks,
and no less than 48 business hours, ahead of time. However, you may be able to schedule an
appointment sooner by visiting a license branch. You must provide your own vehicle for the
driving skills exam. There is no charge for the driving skills exam administered by the BMV.

FINANCIAL LIABILIT Y FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE
Applicants for a learner’s permit or probationary driver’s license who are less than 18 years
of age must have one of the following adults sign a sworn or affirmed statement of financial
liability in person at a BMV branch. The lawful (IC 9-24-9-3) order of preference is:
1. The parent having custody of the minor applicant or a designee of
7

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

the custodial parent specified by the custodial parent
2. The noncustodial parent (as defined in IC 31-9-2-83) of the minor applicant or a
designee of the noncustodial parent specified by the noncustodial parent
3. The guardian having custody of the minor applicant
4.

In the absence of a person described in one (1) through three (3), any other adult who is
willing to assume the obligations imposed by the provisions of this chapter (IC 9-24-9).

An adult who co-signs for financial liability swears or affirms financial liability for a minor applicant and
agrees to be responsible jointly and severally with the minor applicant for all damage that may result
from operating a motor vehicle. The adult who co-signs for financial liability must present a valid form
of identification from the BMV’s identity documentation list to the BMV while the minor is applying for a
learner’s permit or driver’s license. If at any time, and for any reason, the adult who co-signs for financial
liability wishes to withdraw financial liability for the minor, the adult can file State Form 55834 – Written
Request to Cancel Financial Liability, which is available on the Indiana BMV’s website. A written request
to withdraw financial liability will cancel the minor’s learner’s permit or driver’s license [IC 9-24-9-4(b)].
The signature of an adult on a minor’s application for a driver’s license or learner’s permit is not required
if the applicant is less than 18 years of age and can provide proof that he or she is under the care and
supervision of the Department of Child Services (DCS). If the DCS applicant is applying for a driver’s
license or learner’s permit, the applicant must also provide proof of a motor vehicle insurance policy
that meets the minimum liability standards set forth in Indiana law. Chapter 5 of this manual covers
insurance requirements and penalties for operating a motor vehicle without insurance in more detail.

APPLYING FOR A DRIVER’S LICENSE
There are two types of driver’s license you may apply for: a driver’s license or a commercial driver’s license.
• If you are under the age of 21, then your driver’s license is considered a “probationary”
driver’s license. More information on probationary driver’s licenses is on page 9.
• You must be at least 18 years of age to apply for a CDL and 21 years of age to
apply for a CDL with passenger and/or hazardous material endorsements.
A brief description of each type of driver’s license and various requirements, endorsements, and
restrictions follow. Each topic is also covered in more detail in this chapter and in Chapter 2.

At the time of application for a driver’s license, you must submit a completed State Form
54706 – Log of Supervised Driving Practice, showing proof of the 50 hours of driving
practice. Multiple logs may be used, if necessary, to log the required hours. The log must
be signed by a parent or legal guardian if the applicant is under 18 years of age.

• Six years if you are younger than 75 years of age
• Three years if you are aged 75 through 84
• Two years if you are at least 85 years of age
A driver’s license may not reflect the standard periods of validity for:

Probationary Driver’s License Telecommunications Device Prohibition
Indiana law prohibits all drivers, including probationary driver’s license holders, from
operating a motor vehicle while using any form of telecommunications device,
such as a wireless phone, personal digital assistant, pager, or text messaging
device unless the device is being used to make a 911 emergency call.

Dropping Out, Being Suspended, or Being Expelled from School

• The juvenile is under an expulsion, exclusion, or second or subsequent
suspension from school during one school year
• The juvenile has been determined to be a habitual truant, or
• The juvenile has withdrawn from school

Renewing a Probationary Driver’s License to an Unrestricted Driver’s License
When you renew your probationary driver’s license after turning 21 years of age, you will receive
an unrestricted driver’s license. An unrestricted driver’s license removes the restrictions stated
previously in this section that are imposed on probationary driver’s license holders. Holders
of unrestricted driver’s licenses should always be aware of the public safety restrictions and
prohibitions that apply to all motor vehicle drivers regardless of their license type listed on page 11.

COMMERCIAL LEARNER’S PERMIT AND COMMERCIAL

motor vehicles or combination of vehicles, such as semi-tractor trailers, with declared gross
vehicle weight ratings in excess of 26,000 pounds; vehicles designed or used to transport 16
or more people, including the driver; and vehicles used to transport hazardous materials

a new, renewed, amended, or replacement credential. Your credential will be sent to the mailing
address on file with the BMV and will arrive at your mailing address within 14 calendar days.
Please note, credentials will only be mailed to the address on file with the BMV and will not
be forwarded. If you have temporarily or permanently changed your mailing address
with the United States Postal Service, you must update your address with the Indiana
BMV as well. Failure to do so will prevent delivery of your credential. You can update your
address with the Indiana BMV at a BMV branch, IN.gov/BMV, or a BMV Connect kiosk.

PUBLIC SAFET Y RESTRICTIONS AND PROHIBITIONS
Seat Belts

Indiana law requires all occupants of a motor vehicle equipped with a seat belt that is standard
equipment installed by the manufacturer to wear the seat belt any time the motor vehicle is in motion.

Telecommunications Device Prohibition

Indiana Law prohibits individuals from using a telecommunications device to
type, transmit, or read a text or an email message while operating a moving motor
vehicle unless the device is used in conjunction with hands-free or voice-operated
technology, or unless the device is used to make a 911 emergency call.
Indiana law defines a telecommunications device as an electronic or digital device, such as a
wireless telephone, personal digital assistant, pager, or text messaging device. This definition does
not include citizen band (CB) radio equipment that is being operated by a person licensed as a CB
radio operator by the Federal Communications Commission or a communications system installed
in a commercial motor vehicle weighing more than 10,000 pounds. You may be assessed points
on your driver record when using a telecommunication device while operating a motor vehicle.

SPECIAL NEEDS RESTRICTIONS ON A CREDENTIAL
BMV examiners determine whether to issue a driver’s license with restrictions to an individual
with disabilities affecting his or her normal operation of a standard-equipped vehicle. A
restricted driver’s license may specify particular equipment that the driver needs while
operating a vehicle, or other restrictions to accommodate the individual’s specific needs.

MOTORCYCLE LE ARNER’S PERMIT
A motorcycle learner’s permit allows Indiana residents to practice riding a motorcycle
before applying for a motorcycle endorsement. You may apply for a motorcycle learner’s
permit at any BMV branch. To obtain a motorcycle learner’s permit you must:
• Hold a valid Indiana driver’s license
• Pass a knowledge exam based on the Motorcycle Operator’s Manual

Motorcycle Learner’s Permit Driving Privileges

If you hold a motorcycle learner’s permit and choose to operate a motorcycle or, you
must wear a helmet when you operate the vehicle and may only ride without passengers
during the period of one-half hour before sunrise and one-half hour after sunset.

Motorcycle Learner’s Permit Validity

A motorcycle learner’s permit is valid for one year from the date of issuance. A motorcycle learner’s
permit may be renewed one time for a period of one year. If you do not obtain a motorcycle endorsement
before the expiration of the renewed permit, you must wait one year to reapply for a new motorcycle
learner’s permit, or you must successfully complete a motorcycle safety course with an approved
Ride Safe Indiana provider. A list of approved providers can be found at RideSafeIndiana.com.

MOTORCYCLE ENDORSEMENT
A motorcycle endorsement may be issued to Indiana residents who hold a valid Indiana
driver’s license. If you are obtaining your Indiana driver’s license for the first time, you
can get a motorcycle endorsement at the same time, provided you are 16 years and
90 days of age or older and have completed a motorcycle safety course.
To obtain a motorcycle endorsement, drivers of all ages must successfully
complete a motorcycle safety course with an approved Ride Safe Indiana
provider or pass both the motorcycle knowledge and riding skills exams.
New Indiana residents who hold a valid motorcycle endorsement or motorcycle
driver’s license from another state may add a motorcycle endorsement to their valid
Indiana driver’s license after passing the motorcycle knowledge exam.
Your Indiana motorcycle endorsement is valid for the same period of time as your Indiana
driver’s license. You may renew your driver’s license with a motorcycle endorsement

13

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

at any Indiana BMV branch or online up to two years before the license expires. If you
currently hold an unexpired driver’s license with a motorcycle endorsement, you will not
be required to pay the fee for the endorsement when you renew your license.
The Indiana BMV strongly encourages you to participate in a motorcycle safety course offered by a
Ride Safe Indiana provider. For more information on how to obtain your motorcycle endorsement,
motorcycle safety and training courses, or riding skills exams, please visit RideSafeIndiana.com.

MOTOR DRIVEN CYCLE (MDC)
MDC – Motor Driven Cycle
Indiana law defines a vehicle as an MDC if:
• It has a seat or saddle for the use of the rider
• It is designed to travel on no more than three wheels in contact with the ground
• It complies with applicable state and federal motor vehicle equipment requirements
• It has a cylinder capacity not exceeding 50 cubic centimeters, and
• It is registered as an MDC or MDC – Class B
You may apply for an MDC endorsement on your identification card if you successfully complete the
MDC knowledge exam. The MDC endorsement will be added to your identification card during your
next issuance. You do not need an MDC endorsement if you hold a valid (not expired, suspended, or
revoked) Indiana learner’s permit or driver’s license.
The following restrictions apply to the operation of an MDC:
• Must be at least 15 years of age
• Must wear a helmet if under 18 years of age
• Must wear protective glasses, goggles, or transparent face shields if under 18 years of age
• Must operate in a position astride (legs on each side of) the seat

CHAPTER 2 | Restrictions and Endorsements

AUTOCYCLES
Operating an Autocycle

Indiana law defines a vehicle as an autocycle if it is a three-wheeled motor vehicle in which the
operator and passenger ride in a completely or partially enclosed seating area that is equipped with:
• A roll cage or roll hoops,
• Safety belts for each occupant,
• Anti-lock brakes, and
• Is designed to be controlled with a steering wheel and pedals

You may operate an autocycle on Indiana roadways if you possess a valid (not expired, suspended, or
revoked) Indiana driver’s license. A motorcycle learner’s permit or motorcycle endorsement is not required.
The following restrictions apply to the operation of an autocycle:
• Must operate in a position on a seat
• Cannot carry package in hand
• May not operate more than one autocycle in a single traffic lane
• Operator and each occupant must wear a seat belt
• May not be used for the purpose of a driving skills exam for a driver’s license

FOR-HIRE ENDORSEMENT
A for-hire endorsement provides the credential holder privileges to operate a motor vehicle that is:
• Registered as having a gross weight of at least 16,000 pounds, but not more than
26,000 pounds and operated for the purpose of transporting property for hire; or
• Designed to transport fewer than 16 passengers, including the driver, and operated for the purpose
of transporting passengers for hire.
A for-hire endorsement does not allow the credential holder to operate a commercial
motor vehicle. Indiana residents who hold a commercial driver’s license (CDL) and wish
to operate in a “for-hire” capacity (such as operating as a limo, cab driver, or ride share)
must pass a for-hire knowledge exam and apply for the for-hire endorsement.
A for-hire endorsement may be issued to Indiana residents who are at least 18 years of age and
who have held a valid Indiana driver’s license for at least one year. To obtain a driver’s license with
a for-hire endorsement, you must pass both a driver knowledge exam and the for-hire knowledge
exam. If you currently hold an unexpired driver’s license, you will only need to pass the for-hire exam.
New Indiana residents who are at least 18 years of age and who hold a valid driver’s license, chauffeur’s
license, public passenger chauffeur’s license, or CDL with a for-hire endorsement from another state may
add a for-hire endorsement to their Indiana driver’s license after passing the for-hire knowledge exam.
Effective January 1, 2017, all applicants who currently hold an unexpired Indiana public passenger
chauffeur’s or chauffeur’s license will have their license type transferred to a driver’s license with a
for-hire endorsement during their next credential transaction. There are no examination requirements
and the for-hire endorsement fee is waived during your transaction. If you do not currently hold an
Indiana chauffeur’s or public passenger chauffeur’s license, all applicable exams and fees will apply.
Your Indiana for-hire endorsement is valid for the same period of time as your Indiana
driver’s license. You may renew your driver’s license with a for-hire endorsement at
any Indiana BMV branch or online up to one year before the license expires.
The BMV does not require a medical examination report in order to issue a driver’s license
with the for-hire endorsement. If you are not sure if the vehicle you are operating requires a
completed medical examination report, contact the Indiana Department of Transportation.

15

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

A for-hire bus is defined as a bus used to carry passengers for-hire, or operated for compensation.
The following are not considered transporting for hire:
• Operating a medical services vehicle
• Transporting a recreational vehicle before the first retail sale of the recreational vehicle when:
» The gross weight of the recreational vehicle is not greater than 26,000 pounds, or
» The gross combination weight of the recreational vehicle and towing vehicle is not greater
than 26,000 pounds, including the gross weight of the towed recreational vehicle, and
the weight of the towed recreational vehicle is not greater than 10,000 pounds
• Operating a motor vehicle that is registered as having a gross weight of
less than 16,000 pounds and used to transport property for hire

CHAUFFEUR’S AND PUBLIC PASSENGER CHAUFFEUR’S LICENSES
If you wish to maintain your Indiana chauffeur’s or public passenger chauffeur’s license after it
expires or approaches expiration, you are required to apply for a driver’s license with a for-hire
endorsement. The chauffeur’s or public passenger chauffeur’s license may not be replaced,
amended, or renewed online. You must visit a BMV branch to transfer to a driver’s license with
for-hire endorsement. Since you are required to visit a BMV branch to change license type(s),
the BMV encourages you to upgrade to a Real ID-compliant credential during your visit. For a
complete list of documents required to obtain a Real ID-compliant credential, see Appendix
A (p. 66) of this manual or visit REALID.IN.gov. If you have questions about collecting your
documents, you can call the Indiana BMV toll-free at 888-692-6841 to speak with a customer
service representative, or visit any branch for assistance. There is no additional cost.

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

If you are younger than 15 years of age, you may not operate a watercraft
with an engine output of more than 10 horsepower.
If your driver’s license is suspended, you may not operate a watercraft. If you
operate your watercraft recklessly, while intoxicated, or break private watercraft
laws, you may have points assessed against your driver record.
On Indiana boundary waters, Indiana residents operating a watercraft are required to carry an
Indiana driver’s license. Residents of other states are not required to carry a driver’s license
unless they are operating a watercraft in an embayment, river, or stream in Indiana.

PARKING PL ACARDS
A parking placard allows the holder to use parking spaces designated for individuals with disabilities.
The placard is available for individuals with a permanent or temporary disability as well as a person
who has been issued or is otherwise eligible to receive a Disabled Hoosier Veteran (DHV) license plate.
Also, any company empowered by the state or a political subdivision to operate programs, including the
provision of transportation or facilities for persons with physical disabilities, may apply for a placard.
To apply for a parking placard, you must have a health care provider (e.g. a physician,
chiropractor, podiatrist, advanced practice registered nurse, physician’s assistant,
optometrist or ophthalmologist) complete the Application for Disability Parking Placard or
Disability Plate – State Form 42070 affirming that you qualify for a parking placard.
After you have completed State Form 42070, you may get a parking placard
at any BMV branch or by mailing it to the address on the form.
Certification by a health care provider is not required when the person has
received or is eligible to receive a Disabled Hoosier Veteran license plate.
If you have a permanent disability, your parking placard does not expire unless your
health care provider certifies that the disability is no longer considered permanent
or the Indiana Department of Veteran Affairs (IDVA) certifies that you are no longer a
Disabled Hoosier Veteran. There is no fee for a permanent parking placard.
If you have a temporary disability, your parking placard expires on the date indicated by the
health care provider or one year after the date of issuance, whichever occurs first. There
is a fee for a temporary parking placard. Refer to IN.gov/BMV for more information.
A placard issued to a company expires on January 1 of the fourth year after the year
that follows the date the placard was issued, or the date the company ceases to
operate programs or facilities for persons with disabilities, whichever is sooner.
Î Use of an expired placard could result in a fine.
Parking in the diagonally striped space next to a reserved parking
space is prohibited at all times, even with a valid placard.

CHAPTER 4 | Renewing, Amending, or Replacing a Credential

CHAPTER FOUR |
RENEWING, AMENDING, OR REPLACING A CREDENTIAL
As noted in Chapter 1, the BMV issues three types of credentials: driver’s licenses, learner’s
permits, and identification cards. Once your credential has been issued, it is valid for a defined
period of time and may be renewed, amended, or replaced based on your circumstances.
Please read the section titled For-Hire Endorsement in Chapter 2 for information on
renewing, amending, or replacing a chauffeur’s or public passenger chauffeur’s license.
If you lose your credential while temporarily residing outside of Indiana, you may obtain an interim
credential subject to certain qualifications. If your residential address, name, or gender has not
changed, you may replace or renew your credential online at IN.gov/BMV, if eligible. You may renew
your credential online or on a BMV Connect kiosk every other renewal. For a full listing of the online
renewal, replacement, and amended credentials requirements, continue reading or visit IN.gov/BMV.

RENEWING A CREDENTIAL
A probationary driver’s license expires when the card holder is 21 years and 30 days
of age. A probationary driver’s license may be renewed online if the holder meets
the requirements. All other credentials expire at midnight on your birthday.
If your birthday falls on a day when BMV branches are closed, your credential
expires at midnight on the next business day. Credential expiration dates
vary for residents with temporary lawful status. All individuals are subject to an
administrative penalty if your credential is renewed after the expiration date.
If you are renewing a driver’s license that has been expired for at least 180
days but not more than five years, you must pay an administrative penalty,
pass a knowledge exam, and pass a standard vision screening.
If you are renewing a driver’s license that has been expired for five
years or more, you must pay an administrative penalty, pass a knowledge
exam, a driving skills exam, and a standard vision screening.
A driver’s license or identification card may be renewed by U.S. citizens or individuals
with permanent lawful status up to 24 months before the credential expiration.
Individuals with lawful temporary status can only renew up to 30 days prior to the expiration of
their current credential. A learner’s permit may be renewed up to 31 days before it expires.
Î If you are at least 21 years of age and have six or more active points on your driving
record, you must take the knowledge exam to renew your driver’s license.

Driver’s License Renewal for United States Armed Forces Personnel

If you are temporarily living outside of Indiana because you are serving with the United States
Armed Forces, your driver’s license remains valid for 90 days following your discharge from
service or post-deployment. If you meet certain requirements, you may renew your driver’s
license online at IN.gov/BMV. Visit IN.gov/BMV for a listing of those requirements.
If your Indiana driver’s license is expired and you wish to obtain a renewed license after you
have been discharged, you must visit a BMV branch to provide Department of Defense
documentation showing proof of military discharge or your long form DD 214. You may also
choose to add a veteran indicator to your credential at that time, provided you bring your long
form DD 214 into the BMV branch with you to renew or amend your driver’s license.

19

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

AMENDING A CREDENTIAL
After you have legally changed any personal information, you must amend the information
that appears on your credential. You may amend your credential at any BMV branch.
Below are a few common reasons you may need to amend your credential.

Address Change

If you have an Indiana credential, you must notify the BMV of a change of your principal (legal)
address and apply for an amended credential within 30 days of the address change.

To change your principal (legal) address on your credential, you must visit a
BMV branch to present documents as described in Appendix A.
Î You may change your mailing address online at IN.gov/BMV, at
a BMV Connect kiosk, or at a license branch.

Name Change

You must visit a Social Security Administration office to officially change your name on Social Security
documentation and allow at least one business day after your name change transaction is completed
before visiting a BMV branch to amend your credential. You will need to visit a BMV branch to apply
for an amended credential within 30 days of a name change. You must present documents
as described in Appendix A. If you need to replace your SSA card, and your current Indiana
license, permit or identification card is not expired, you may do so online for free.

Gender Change

If you have a gender change procedure and hold an Indiana credential, you may visit a BMV branch
to apply for an amended credential that indicates the change from male to female or from female
to male. You must present a certified amended birth certificate or a physician’s signed and dated
statement, on letterhead, that includes the language from 140 IAC 7-1.1-3 “<insert customer’s name>
successfully underwent all treatment necessary to permanently change <insert customer’s name>
gender from <insert old gender> to <insert new gender>”, or a Physician’s Statement of Gender
Change – State Form 55617, completed in its entirety by both the applicant and the physician.

REPL ACING A CREDENTIAL
If you lose your credential or if it is stolen, you may replace it by logging into your IN.gov/BMV
account or visit a BMV Connect kiosk to order a replacement, provided your name, gender, or
residential address information has not changed. You may replace your credential online a

DRIVER SAFET Y PROGR AM
The BMV has approved a limited number of Driver Safety Program (DSP) providers. A
BMV-approved DSP is a defensive driving curriculum available in classroom, online,
or DVD instruction formats. A BMV-approved DSP course provides a summary of
defensive driving techniques and can be a beneficial refresher course for drivers.
Any Indiana driver may complete a DSP course from a BMV-approved provider and receive a fourpoint credit. However, Indiana drivers required by the BMV to participate in a DSP will receive a mailed
notification indicating that they must successfully complete a BMV-approved DSP within 90 days of
the date on the notification. Each driver is allowed one four-point credit during a three-year period.
The BMV may require drivers 21 years of age and older who are convicted of two
or more traffic offenses within a 12-month period to complete a BMV-approved
DSP course. Individuals under 21 years of age may be required to complete a BMVapproved DSP course if they are convicted of two or more traffic offenses.
Failure to complete a DSP course within 90 days from the date of the BMV’s mailed notice
will result in the suspension of your driving privileges. The suspension will be in effect until
you successfully complete the DSP course, and the completion is processed by the BMV.

21

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

A judge may also order a driver who commits a traffic offense to attend a DSP. If a court orders you to
complete a DSP, the type of DSP you will be required to complete is at the court’s discretion. However, the
four-point credit will only be applied to your driver record if you complete a BMV-approved DSP course.
The maximum fee for any BMV-approved DSP is $55. Allow 7 to 10 business days for completion
results to be processed by the BMV. Make your check or money order payable to the DSP provider.
Î A list of DSP providers is available at IN.gov/BMV or by calling 888-692-6841.

INSUR ANCE REQUIREMENTS
Indiana law states a person may not operate a motor vehicle in Indiana if financial responsibility
is not in effect with respect to the motor vehicle, or the person is not otherwise insured to operate
the motor vehicle. Driving without a current liability insurance policy that meets the state minimum
standard is against the law. The state minimum insurance standard is $25,000 for bodily injury to, or
the death of, one individual; $50,000 for bodily injury to, or the death of, two or more people in any
one accident; and $25,000 for property damages in any one accident. This is commonly referred to
as 25/50/25 liability insurance. To deter uninsured drivers, Indiana law requires the BMV to impose
driving privilege suspensions and financial penalties on motorists who are found to have operated
a vehicle in Indiana without proof that they hold the state minimum requirement for auto insurance.
Penalties include reinstatement fees and suspensions that can range from 90 days to one year.

Proof of Financial Responsibility

Do not delay when you receive a notification from the BMV to provide proof of financial responsibility
(proof of insurance). Immediately contact your automobile insurance provider and request that an
employee electronically submit a Certificate of Compliance (COC) to the BMV. You may receive a
notice to verify financial responsibility from the BMV as the result of any of the following situations:
• An auto accident
• A pointable moving traffic violation within one year of receiving
two other pointable moving traffic violations
• A serious traffic violation such as a misdemeanor or felony
• Any pointable moving traffic violation by a driver who was previously
suspended for failing to provide proof of financial responsibility

A properly filed COC will demonstrate that the vehicle you were operating at the time of the incident
or accident was insured to the state’s minimum motor vehicle liability protection (25/50/25). The
COC must be received electronically and processed by the BMV within 90 days of the BMV’s
mailing of a request to verify financial responsibility, or your driving privileges will be suspended.
Once your driving privileges are suspended, you may have a BMV-imposed suspension removed
from your driving record by having your insurance provider submit proof of financial responsibility. This
typically requires your insurance provider to submit a COC covering you and the vehicle indicated
in the citation or accident report for the date of the incident or accident. If you were operating a
company-owned vehicle or rental vehicle, your employer or the rental company must fill out an
Affidavit – Proof of Financial Responsibility for Employer or Rental Vehicles – State Form 55434.
If you are convicted by an Indiana court, or by an out-of-state court, for operating a
vehicle without insurance, you must contact the court to determine if you can provide
proof of insurance to them to remove the conviction from your driving record.
If your driving privileges are suspended as a result of a court conviction for operating a vehicle without
financial responsibility or for failing to file insurance with the BMV, Indiana law requires that you have
your insurance provider electronically file proof of future financial responsibility with an SR22 form in
order for your driving privileges to be reinstated. A failure to file an SR22 will result in the continuation
of a suspension on your driving record until your insurance provider files an effective SR22.

22

CHAPTER 5 | Points, Suspension, and Insurance Requirements

SR22 Requirement Period
The SR22 form demonstrates that you have a motor vehicle insurance policy that meets
the state’s minimum standards and it cannot be canceled without prior notice given to
the BMV. When you have an SR22 requirement, you must maintain an effective SR22
policy on file with the BMV. No-insurance suspensions that became effective on or after
12/31/2021 are indefinite suspensions. Indefinite no-insurance suspensions can be stayed
upon receipt of SR22 and terminated by maintaining SR22 continuously for 180 days.
If you have an SR22 requirement and the BMV receives an SR26 (cancellation of SR22 insurance)
notice from your insurance provider, Indiana law requires the BMV to suspend your driving privileges
until it receives an effective SR22 policy, or until the SR22 requirement period expires. If the BMV
receives an SR26 during the 180 day stay for an indefinite no-insurance suspension, Indiana law
requires the BMV to remove the stay and placed the suspension back into an active status.

No-Insurance Reinstatement Fees

A driver who operates a motor vehicle without a liability insurance policy that meets the state’s
minimum standards is subject to a suspension of driving privileges. Additionally, once that insurance
suspension has expired, Indiana law requires you to pay a fee to reinstate your driving privileges;
this is in addition to any SR22 requirement. Reinstatement fees are $250 for a first no-insurance
suspension, $500 for a second no-insurance suspension, and $1,000 for a third and subsequent noinsurance suspension(s) that occurred after Jan. 1, 2015. For no-insurance suspensions prior to Jan. 1,
2015, reinstatement fees of $150 for a first no-insurance suspension, $225 for a second no-insurance
suspension, and $300 for a third and subsequent no-insurance suspension(s) will be required. A driver
may reinstate their driving privileges without having to pay a no-insurance reinstatement fee by having
their insurance provider electronically submit proof of future financial responsibility (SR22 form) and
maintain SR22 continuously for 180 days. If the BMV receives an SR26 during the 180 day SR22
stay period, the fees will be placed back into an active status until payment is received or SR22.
You may pay reinstatement fees at IN.gov/BMV, by telephone at 888-692-6841, or by
mail using the reinstatement fee coupon that you receive in the mail from the BMV.

SUSPENSIONS
Indiana law provides courts with the authority to order the BMV to suspend
an individual’s driving privileges under certain circumstances, including when
he or she is found to have committed certain traffic violations.

Failure to Appear in Court or Pay Traffic Offenses

Failing to appear before a court of law in response to a citation issued by a law enforcement officer,
or not paying tickets after a judgment has been entered, may lead to the suspension of your driving
privileges. The court will notify the BMV to close the suspension after you have appeared in court or
paid the citation. You may stay the suspension by having your insurance provider electronically submit
proof of future financial responsibility (SR22 form) and maintaining SR22 for the duration of the stay.

Driving While Suspended

Driving while suspended is a serious traffic violation. Driving while suspended with a prior offense
can result in a misdemeanor or felony conviction on your driving record. The penalties imposed
by the court can be significant and convictions can result in increased insurance premiums. The
BMV strongly encourages you to not operate a motor vehicle with a suspended driver’s license.

Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated

Operating a vehicle while intoxicated or with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in excess of the
legal limit (.08) is a criminal offense and has an immediate effect on your privilege to operate a
vehicle. The primary factors in determining an individual’s BAC are the amount of alcohol consumed,
how quickly the alcohol is consumed, and the individual’s body weight. If a law enforcement officer
has probable cause to believe that a motorist committed an offense under IC 9-30-5, IC 9-30-6, IC

23

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

9-30-9, or IC 9-30-15, the officer may ask the motorist to submit to a chemical test to determine the
amount of alcohol in the person’s system. If a judge finds that probable cause exists, such that a
person operated a vehicle while intoxicated, that person may face a suspension of driving privileges.
• A motorist who fails a chemical test will face a suspension of driving privileges for 180 days.
• A motorist who refuses to submit to a chemical test will face a
suspension of driving privileges for one year.
• A motorist with a previous conviction for operating while intoxicated who refuses to
submit to a chemical test will face a suspension of driving privileges for two years.
In addition to a probable-cause suspension, a court may suspend a person’s driving privileges
following a conviction for operating while intoxicated. The suspension periods may be longer for
repeat offenders. Penalties for this offense may include conditions placed on your driving privileges.
If the motorist is eligible, the court may issue an order for specialized driving privileges. The
court may also require the installation of an ignition interlock device, which mechanically
tests the driver’s blood alcohol level before his or her car can be started.
When a driver who is under 18 years of age is cited for operating a vehicle while intoxicated,
the Juvenile Court may also recommend a suspension of his or her driving privileges.

Operating a Watercraft While Intoxicated

If you are convicted of operating a watercraft while intoxicated, your driving privileges
are subject to the same penalties as an operator of a motor vehicle.

A conviction of operating a watercraft while intoxicated is forwarded to the
BMV and the conviction becomes part of your driver record.
Other offenses related to the operation of a watercraft, such as reckless operation
endangering the safety of others or operating a watercraft when your driving
privileges have been suspended, will also be added to your driver record.

Failure to Pay Child Support

A court that has determined a parent is delinquent in paying child support may order
the BMV to immediately suspend the delinquent parent’s driving privileges until the
BMV receives an order from the court to reinstate the parent’s driving privileges.
If the local agency responsible for enforcing child support payments determines either that a
parent failed to appear for a hearing or appeared and was found to be delinquent, then that
agency may also send an order to the BMV requiring that the parent’s driving privileges be
suspended until the BMV is notified that the parent has paid or established a payment plan.

Making Payment to the BMV with Dishonored Funds

The BMV will indefinitely suspend your driving privileges if you submit payment to the BMV for any
services or fees and that payment was not honored. To reinstate your driving privileges, you must
pay the amount of the obligation plus all applicable service, collection and reinstatement fees.

Checking Your Driver Record and Reinstatement

After you have resolved any problems with your driver record, you may be eager to obtain a
valid credential and get back on the road. Your first resource should be to check your driver
record, which you may view anytime at no charge at IN.gov/BMV. For your first visit, you will
be required to establish a IN.gov/BMV account. The “Viewable Driver Record” on myBMV.
com includes your driver’s license status, as well as information about citations, suspensions,
and how to reinstate your driving privileges if you have outstanding requirements.
Once you log into IN.gov/BMV, select ”Driver Record” on the left-hand side of
the page, then select the “Viewable Driver Record” to see your record.

24

CHAPTER 5 | Points, Suspension, and Insurance Requirements

There is also an “Official Driver Record” that may be purchased for $4. Any outstanding reinstatement
requirements, along with the date you are eligible for reinstatement, will be listed in the “Reinstatement
Requirements” box near the top of the viewable driver record or on your Official Driver Record.
If your driving privileges are still suspended by a court, the court’s phone number will be listed
with the associated court-ordered suspension. You may contact the court to find out how to fulfill
any of their requirements for a particular suspension. Once the court’s requirements are fulfilled,
the court will send reinstatement information directly to the BMV for processing. Processing by
the BMV may take up to 10 business days once the information is received from the court.
Î Note: The Viewable Driver Record cannot be printed and should not be used as an official
transcript of your driver record. The Official Driver Record is an official transcript of your driver
record and can be used by individuals, courts, state agencies, and employers. You will be able
to print your Official Driver Record for up to 30 days after you have purchased it. An electronic
version of the Official Driver Record is also provided when purchased at IN.gov/BMV. Individuals
are also able to purchase and print their Official Driver Record at a BMV Connect kiosk.

HABITUAL TR AFFIC VIOL ATORS
Indiana law provides serious penalties for drivers who have repeatedly committed traffic offenses
over a 10-year period. The BMV uses the criteria in statute, which are summarized in the
following sections to determine whether a driver qualifies as a Habitual Traffic Violator (HTV).

Section A (10-Year or Life Suspension): Two Major Offenses
Resulting in Injury or Death

An HTV is a person who, within a 10-year period, accumulates two judgments
resulting in injury or death. Below is a reference of some of the criminal offenses
that will result in an HTV status being placed on your driving privileges:
• Reckless homicide resulting from operation of a motor vehicle
• Voluntary or involuntary manslaughter resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle
• An operator involved in an accident resulting in death or injury who fails to stop
at the scene of the accident to provide information and assistance
• Operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated resulting in death
• Operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08 or more resulting in death
Drivers who accumulate two judgments from the above list within a 10-year
period will have their driving privileges suspended for 10 years.
Drivers who accumulate two judgments within a 10-year period for operating a motor vehicle
while intoxicated resulting in death, or operating a motor vehicle with blood alcohol content
of .08 percent or more resulting in death, will have their driving privileges suspended for life.
Prior to June 30, 2001, drivers who accumulated two judgments within a 10- year
period for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated resulting in death, or operating
a motor vehicle with blood alcohol content of .10 percent and 210 liters of their breath
or more resulting in death, had their driving privileges suspended for life.

Section B (10-Year Suspension): Three Major Offenses

Drivers who, within a 10-year period, accumulate three judgments from the
below list will have their driving privileges suspended for 10 years.
• Driving while intoxicated or with a blood alcohol content of .08 percent or more
• Prior to June 30, 2001, drivers who were convicted of operating a motor vehicle with
blood alcohol content of .10 percent and 210 liters of their breath or more
• Prior to July 1, 1997, drivers who were convicted of operating a motor vehicle

25

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

while intoxicated resulting in death, or operating a motor vehicle with blood
alcohol content of .10 percent and 210 liters of their breath or more
• Reckless driving
• Criminal recklessness as a felony involving the operation of a motor vehicle
• Drag racing or engaging in a speed contest in violation of the law
• Leaving the scene of an accident or failing to notify authorities of an accident when required
• Resisting law enforcement under IC 35-44.1-3-1
• Any felony under an Indiana motor vehicle statute or any felony in
which the operation of a vehicle is an element of the offense
• Operating a Motor Driven Cycle – Class B in violation of IC 9-24-1-1(b)
• Any of the offenses listed in Section A

Section C: Ten Traffic Offenses in a Ten-Year Period

An HTV under this section is subject to a five-year driving privilege suspension for a
person who has accumulated 10 or more traffic violations in a 10-year period, one
of which is a major offense as listed in Section A or B or one of the following:
• Operating a motor vehicle while the person’s license has been suspended or revoked
as a result of the person’s convictions of an offense under IC 9-1-4-52 (repealed July
1, 1991), IC 9-24-18-5(b) (repealed July 1, 2000), IC 9-24-19-2, or IC 9-24-19-3
• Operating a motor vehicle without ever having obtained a driver’s license
For example, a person with nine speeding tickets and one reckless driving conviction
in a 10-year period will be subject to a five-year suspension as an HTV.

Operating a Vehicle While Suspended as an HTV

Indiana law states that a person who is convicted of operating a vehicle while suspended
as an HTV may have other driving privileges suspended for a period set by the court.

Restriction 5: Probationary or Specialized Driving Privileges

A “Restriction 5” is placed on the driver’s license of a person who has been granted
hardship, probationary, conditional, or specialized driving privileges by court order.
Restriction 2 will no longer be added to driver records for HTV suspensions/ HTV
probationary driver’s licenses expiring on or after January 1, 2015.

SR22 Insurance and Specialized Driving Privileges

A person who has been granted specialized driving privileges by a court shall:
• Maintain an effective SR22 on file with the BMV for the duration of specialized driving privileges
• Carry a copy of the court order granting specialized driving privileges
or have the order in the vehicle being operated by the person
• Produce the copy of the order granting specialized driving privileges upon the request of
a law enforcement
• Carry a validly issued credential during the operation of any motor vehicle

CHAPTER 6 | Traffic Signs and Signals

CHAPTER SIX | TRAFFIC SIGNS AND SIGNALS
Traffic signs control traffic flow, making streets and highways safe for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians.
These signs, which are posted by the Indiana Department of Transportation and local governments,
use colors, shapes, written messages, and symbols to help drivers quickly understand the information.
Understanding these signs is necessary to obtain an Indiana driver’s license.

TR AFFIC SIGN COLORS
The background color of a traffic sign helps to identify the type of information displayed on the sign.
There are seven colors commonly used for signs.

Red Traffic Signs

Red traffic signs convey traffic regulations that require drivers to
take immediate action to avoid threats to traffic safety. A “Wrong
Way” sign is an example of a traffic sign with a red background.

Yellow or Fluorescent Yellow-Green Traffic Signs

Yellow or fluorescent yellow-green signs prepare drivers for specific
road conditions and hazards ahead, and alert drivers to nearby
school zones. A “Slippery When Wet” sign is one example of a traffic
sign with a yellow background. Fluorescent yellow-green signs warn
drivers of nearby schools, pedestrians, bicycles, playgrounds, and
school bus routes. A “Pedestrian Crossing” sign for a school crossing
is an example of a traffic sign that may have a fluorescent yellowgreen background.

White Traffic Signs

White Traffic signs display traffic regulations, such as speed limits,
that drivers must obey, as well as helpful information such as state
highway markers. A “No Turn On Red” sign is an example of a traffic
sign with a white background.

Orange Traffic Signs

Orange traffic signs warn drivers of temporary traffic conditions.
These signs are often used to warn drivers of conditions ahead due
to highway constructions and maintenance projects. A “Flagger Ahead”
sign is an example of a traffic sign with an orange background.

Green Traffic Signs

Green traffic signs indicate permitted movements and directions
or guidance, such as highway entrances and exits or distance to
upcoming destinations. A sign showing distance is an example of a
traffic sign with a green background.

Blue Traffic Signs

Blue traffic signs display road services and information. A sign
showing information about amenities at an upcoming exit is an
example of a traffic sign with a blue background.

Brown Traffic Signs

Brown traffic signs indicate nearby recreational and cultural interest
sites. A sign showing a nearby state park is an example of a traffic
sign with a brown background.
27

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

TR AFFIC SIGN SHAPES
The shape of a traffic sign also indicates the type of information displayed on the sign. There are seven
common shapes used for traffic signs.

Circular Traffic Signs

Circular traffic signs alert drivers to upcoming railroad crossings.

Equilateral Triangle Traffic Signs

Traffic signs with three sides of equal length warn drivers to slow
down when approaching an intersection, and to be prepared to come
to a complete stop in order to yield to other drivers or pedestrians.

Pennant-Shaped Traffic Signs

Pennant-shaped traffic signs are posted on the left-hand side of twoway roads to warn drivers not to pass other vehicles on the left.

Rectangular Traffic Signs

Rectangular traffic signs display one of three types of information.
They may convey traffic regulations that drivers must obey, such as
speed limits and turn movement prohibitions like “No Left Turn.”
They may provide helpful information such as route marker signs
that identify a state highway, or destination signs that give the
direction to the next town.
They may also warn drivers of hazardous conditions such as an
advisory speed for a sharp curve in the roadway.
This advisory speed sign is often posted with a diamond- shaped
warning sign.

Diamond-Shaped Traffic Signs

Diamond-shaped traffic signs warn drivers of upcoming road
conditions and hazards. A “slippery when wet” sign is an example
of a diamond-shaped traffic sign.

Five-Sided Traffic Signs

Five-sided traffic signs warn drivers that they are entering an area
near a school in which children may be crossing the road.

Eight-Sided Traffic Signs

Eight-sided traffic signs warn drivers that they must stop and yield
the appropriate right of way at an intersection.

TR AFFIC SIGNALS
Traffic control devices such as stop lights and signs are used to control traffic flow and indicate right of
way at intersections and pedestrian crossings.

Driving through an Intersection

A green light means go. If you are facing a green light, you have the right of way and may drive through
an intersection as long as the intersection is clear of other vehicles and pedestrians.
A steady yellow light means the green light has ended and the signal is about to turn red. If you are
facing a steady yellow light, your right of way is ending. If you are approaching the intersection and are
too close to stop safely, you may complete your movement.
A red light means stop. Traffic entering an intersection from other directions has the right of way. If you
are facing a red light, you may not enter the intersection until the light facing you turns green and the
intersection is clear.

Turning through an Intersection

If you are facing a green arrow displayed with a red or green light, you have the right of way and may
turn through an intersection, as long as the intersection is clear.
If you are facing a green light displayed without an arrow, you may turn through an intersection as long
as the intersection is clear. You must yield the right of way to all oncoming traffic. Only one vehicle at a
time may move into an intersection to turn left.

Yellow Flashing Arrows for Turning Movements

A yellow flashing arrow for a turning movement means that you may proceed with the turn
only after you have yielded the right of way to pedestrians and oncoming traffic.
If you are facing a steady yellow light or arrow, your right of way is ending.

Turning through a Solid Red Light

If you are facing a red light or arrow, your right of way has ended. If you are in the middle
of an intersection, you may turn once oncoming traffic has stopped. If you are facing a red
light or arrow, you may not enter the intersection until the light facing you turns green and
the intersection is clear.
To turn right through an intersection with a red light or arrow, when permissible, you must come to a full
stop, check to make sure that there are no vehicles and pedestrians in the path of your turn or about to
enter the path of your turn, check that there is not a “No Turn on Red” sign and use the correct lane.

34

CHAPTER 6 | Traffic Signs and Signals

You may turn left through an intersection with a red light or arrow if you are turning from a one-way
street onto a one-way street. You must also come to a full stop, check to make sure that there are no
vehicles and pedestrians in the path of your turn or about to enter the path of your turn, check that there
is not a “No Turn on Red” sign, and use the correct lanes.

Yellow Flashing Lights

A yellow flashing light displayed without an arrow at an intersection means that you
should slow down and use caution when traveling through an intersection. If turning
left, you must yield to oncoming traffic and pedestrians. All traffic on the cross street is
required to yield the right of way to you. However, you should watch for other vehicles
or pedestrians attempting to cross the intersection.
Another type of yellow flashing light is a rectangular rapid flashing beacon.
Rectangular rapid flashing beacons are used at crosswalks and only flash when
activated by a pedestrian.

Red Flashing Lights

A red flashing light at an intersection is equivalent to a stop sign and means that
you must come to a complete stop before proceeding with caution to enter the
intersection.
If you are facing a red flashing light at an intersection at which cross-traffic is not
required to stop, you may proceed only when the intersection is clear and when you
will not interfere with the right of way of cross-traffic.
If you are facing a red flashing light at an intersection at which all traffic is required
to stop, you may proceed only after you have stopped and yielded the right of way to
any vehicle that is already in the intersection, any vehicle that stopped before you and is
entering the intersection, and any vehicle that arrived at the same time as you and is to
your right.

Bicycle Signals

A signal that displays only bicycle symbols controls a bike lane or a separate bike path
and is only applicable to bicyclists. As with vehicular signals, red means stop, yellow
means the right-of-way is ending, and green means go.

Bus or Transit Signals

A signal that displays white rectangular bars control a bus or
transit lane and are only applicable to bus or transit operators.

Approaching a Red Light or Stop Sign

If you are approaching a red light or a stop sign, you must stop at the solid white stop line. If there is
no stop line, you should come to a complete stop perpendicular to the stop sign or before entering the
crosswalk on your side of the intersection. If there is no crosswalk, you should come to a complete stop
before entering the intersection.
Often people who are operating motorcycles, motor driven cycles and bicycles get stuck at a red light
and the signal fails to change to green. These individuals may avoid prolonged waits at red lights under
the following condition:
• An operator approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic signal may proceed through a steady
red light if the operator comes to a complete stop for at least two minutes and exercises due caution
• This rule does not apply to autocycles

Approaching a Yield Sign

A yield sign indicates that a driver must slow down when approaching an intersection and be
prepared to come to a complete stop if a vehicle or pedestrian with the right of way is approaching
from another direction.

35

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

If you are approaching a yield sign, a vehicle approaching from another direction with the right of way
should not have to brake to avoid a collision with you.

Approaching an Intersection with Non-Operating Signal

If you are approaching an intersection with a non-operating signal, you should stop before entering the
intersection. After stopping, you may proceed with caution only after you have yielded the right of way to:
• Cross-traffic that has already entered the intersection
• Any vehicle that stopped before you and is entering the intersection
• Any vehicle that arrived at the same time as you and is to your right
• Any pedestrian traffic

Approaching an Intersection with No Sign or Signal

Before entering a street from an alley or driveway, you should stop and yield the right of way to
other vehicles.

Pedestrian Signals

Pedestrian signals alert pedestrians when they may safely cross a street or intersection.
Pedestrian signals display the word “WALK” or a symbol of a person walking when pedestrians may
safely cross a street or intersection. At some intersections, there is a button near the base of the
pedestrian signal or stop sign that may be pushed to activate the walk signal.
Pedestrian signals display the words “DON’T WALK” or a symbol of a raised hand when it is not safe
for pedestrians to cross a street or intersection. The words or symbols flash to alert pedestrians that the
time in which to safely cross the street or intersection is ending.

Don’t Walk

Don’t Walk

Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons

A pedestrian hybrid beacon is a signal used to facilitate pedestrian crossing, and which may be found at a
mid-block crosswalk. The pedestrian hybrid beacon is dark unless it has been activated by a pedestrian.
Once activated by a pedestrian, the pedestrian hybrid beacon will display a flashing yellow light to allow
drivers to clear the crossing. The flashing yellow will be followed by a steady yellow light to warn drivers
that their right of way is ending. Then, two steady red lights will be displayed while the pedestrian
crosses, and then the two red lights will flash to allow drivers to proceed through if the crossing is clear
of pedestrians. The pedestrian hybrid beacon will then go dark until activated again by a pedestrian.

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

CHAPTER SEVEN | SAFE VEHICLE OPERATION
Even the most experienced drivers can be distracted while driving. A defensive driver
looks out for the actions of other drivers and anticipates potential problems.

L ANE MARKINGS
Lane markings separate traffic and alert drivers when it is permissible to pass other vehicles.

Yellow Lane Markings

Yellow lane markings separate multiple lanes of traffic going in opposite
directions. You may cross a broken yellow line to pass another vehicle when
it is safe, but you should not cross a solid yellow line except to turn.

Two-lane road with a solid yellow line

Two-lane road with a broken
yellow line for no passing zones in
one direction at a time.

White Lane Markings

White lane markings separate multiple lanes of traffic going in the same direction. Most roads
with more than two lanes have broken white lines to separate the lanes. You may cross a
broken white line when it is safe to change lanes, but you should not cross a solid white line.

Three lanes of traffic with
broken white lines

CHANGING L ANES AND PASSING OTHER VEHICLES
Change only one lane at a time. When changing lanes to prepare for a turn, you must signal your
intention to do so at least 200 feet prior to changing lanes or turning. Your signal distance must be at
least 300 feet before the turn if you are operating a vehicle in a speed zone of at least 50 miles per hour.
Do not weave in and out of lanes, which will greatly increase your risk of an accident. On the highway,
slower vehicles should use the right lane. Leave the left-hand lane for faster-moving or passing vehicles.
Follow these rules when you are changing lanes:
• Make sure that there is no traffic ahead of you in the lane you would like to enter
• Check your mirrors for any vehicles that are preparing to pass you
• Briefly turn your head toward the lane that you are entering to make sure that there is no
vehicle in your blind spot and that there is sufficient room to move into the adjacent lane
• Use your turn signal to alert other drivers of your intention to change lanes
• Smoothly move into the new driving lane

37

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

Passing Other Vehicles

Follow these rules when you are passing other vehicles:
• Make sure the passing lane is clear of traffic, as you must return to the right
side of the road no less than 100 feet before any oncoming vehicle
• Check behind and to the left of your vehicle to make sure that another vehicle is not
attempting to pass you
• Use your turn signals to alert other drivers of your intention to change lanes
• Move into the passing lane, accelerate, and continue to move forward until
you can see the vehicle you are passing in your rearview mirror
• Before returning to the lane in which you were originally driving, use the appropriate turn signal

Prohibited Passing

It is dangerous and illegal to try to pass other vehicles in the following situations:
• A solid yellow line is marked on the driver’s side of the center line of the road
• A yellow, pennant-shaped “No Passing Zone” is posted on the left-hand side of the road, or
a white rectangular “Do Not Pass” sign is posted on the right-hand side of the road
• When you are driving on or approaching a curve in the road
• When you are approaching the crest of a hill or grade in the road
• Within 100 feet of an intersection, railroad crossing, bridge, viaduct, or tunnel

Being Passed

If another vehicle is passing you on the left-hand side of the road, allow the
other vehicle to pass safely and do not increase your speed.

RULES FOR SAFE AND LEGAL TURNING
The first rule for a safe and legal turn is to move into the proper lane well before the turn. To turn left, be in
the far left lane for your direction of travel. To turn right, be in the far right lane for your direction of travel.

Signaling Intention to Turn

You must give a proper turn signal before turning or changing lanes.
The safest type of signal is using the lighted signals used in most vehicles. If,
however, one or more of these signals is malfunctioning, you may use hand
signals. You may not use hand signals on a driving skills exam.

Stop or slow

Right turn

Left turn

Turning Left from Specially-Designated Center Lanes

Busy roads on which there are many places a vehicle may make a left turn
often have a center lane designated solely for the left-turning vehicles.

Always be aware that vehicles traveling in the
opposite direction may be entering the center lane
to turn left in front of your vehicle. Never use this
type of center lane for passing other vehicles.
Designated center lanes for left turns can usually be
identified by a sign with alternate directional arrows that state
“CENTER LANE ONLY” or with pavement arrows, although
some center lanes do not have signs or pavement arrows.

Center turn lane with pavement arrows

U-Turns

A U-turn is a maneuver in which a driver changes direction
by making a 180-degree turn. It is potentially dangerous
and should only be undertaken when not prohibited
by law. Follow these rules when making a U-turn:
• Always yield right of way to oncoming
vehicles and pedestrians
• Never make a U-turn on a curve
in the road or when approaching the crest of a hill or grade

Median U-Turn Intersection

• Never make a U-turn on an interstate highway. Instead, proceed to the
next exit and re-enter the highway in the opposite direction
One place where U-turns are permitted and necessary is at an intersection in which the leftturn movement is prohibited in the intersection itself, and the left-turn is made after the driver
proceeds through the intersection and makes a U-turn at an upcoming median opening. These
are known as median U-turn or J-turn intersections and signs are provided to guide drivers.

All-Way Stops

The rules for an all-way stop are like those for a two-way stop: stop and look for oncoming
traffic, then proceed when it is safe to do so. At an all-way stop, the rule is that the first vehicle
to stop at the intersection is the first to proceed through the intersection. However, you may
occasionally arrive at an all-way stop sign at the same time as another driver. The vehicle on

39

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

the left shall yield the right-of-way. However, if there is any doubt which driver has the right of
way or if there is the chance of a crash, it is better to yield the right of way to the other driver.

Some roundabouts have more than one lane, which
can present a traffic hazard when smaller vehicles
are driving through the roundabout alongside larger vehicles, such as tractor-trailers and buses.
When approaching or driving through a multi-lane roundabout, drivers must yield the right of
way to large vehicles driving through the roundabout at the same time. This includes slowing
down or stopping to allow safe passage of the large vehicle through the roundabout.
If two large trucks are approaching or driving through a roundabout at the same time, the
driver in the right lane must yield the right of way to the driver in the left lane. This includes
slowing down or stopping to allow safe passage of the large truck in the left lane.

Following Turning Vehicles

When following a driver who has signaled an intention to make a turn, or who has slowed
down and may be planning to make a turn, you should slow down and be prepared to stop.

SPEED LIMITS
Indiana law requires drivers to operate vehicles at the posted speed limit.
Exceeding the posted speed limit reduces the driver’s ability to steer safely around curves or objects
in the roadway. It also extends the distance required to stop a vehicle in emergency situations. Crash
severity increases with the speed of the vehicle at impact. The effectiveness of vehicular construction
features, as well as of restraint devices like air bags and safety belts, declines as speed increases.

Rural Interstate Highway Speed Limits

Rural interstate highways are located outside urban areas with a population of at
least 50,000 people. The following speed limit rules apply in these areas:
• Passenger vehicles may not exceed 70 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
• Trucks that have a declared gross vehicle weight greater than 26,000 pounds

40

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

may not exceed 65 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
On a rural state divided highway, vehicles may not exceed 60 miles per hour or the posted speed limit.

Urban Speed Limits

Urban areas have a population of at least 50,000 people. The following speed limit rules apply in these areas:
• On an urban interstate highway, vehicles may not exceed 55 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
• On a non-divided state highway, vehicles may not exceed 55 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
• On county roads, vehicles may not exceed 55 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
• In most urban residential areas, vehicles may not exceed 30 miles per hour or the posted speed limit
• In alleys, vehicles may not exceed 15 miles per hour or the posted speed limit

School Zone Speed Limits

If you are driving near a school, you must slow down to the lower, posted speed limit for the
school zone. Common hours for school zone speed limits are 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday
through Friday or when school speed limit beacons are flashing. However, local authorities
may also establish lower speed limits for school zones whenever children are present.

Reduced Speed Limits in Highway Work Zones

Work site speed limits are always at least 10 miles per hour below the maximum established
speed limit for the area. Drivers must adhere to the posted speed limit in a work site. Some
work site speed limits are in effect only when flashing and others are in effect at all times.

School Bus Speed Limits

When not driving on an interstate or state highway, the maximum speed limit for a school bus
is 40 miles per hour unless the posted speed limit is lower. The maximum speed limit for a
school bus on an interstate or highway is 60 miles per hour or the posted speed limit.

Reduce Speed in Dangerous Conditions

Excessive speed, even when conditions are ideal, is dangerous and increases
the likelihood of an accident. Driving at the posted speed limit or in excess of
it during the following roadway conditions is even more dangerous:
• Bad weather and poor visibility

• Unsafe vehicle conditions

• Slick or icy roads

• Impaired physical condition

• Driving with worn tires

• Hazardous conditions on road surface

BR AKING AND FOLLOWING DISTANCES
The following chart provides an indication of how fast or how far a
vehicle travels at 35, 55, and 70 miles per hour.
A good rule for drivers to follow is to stay at least two to three seconds behind
the vehicle ahead. When following a vehicle, watch for it to pass a fixed object
and estimate how much time elapses before you pass the same object.

41

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

• Type and condition of tires
• Physical condition of pavement
• Slickness of pavement
• Grade of road

Skidding

Sudden turns, lane changes, or hard braking can cause a vehicle to skid. The procedure for
correcting a skid is the same for both front-wheel-drive vehicles and rear-wheel-drive vehicles.
If your vehicle begins to lose traction or the rear wheels begin sliding sideways, ease off the gas pedal. Do
not make a fast turn away from the direction of the skid and do not steer too far, which could cause a spin.
If your vehicle has conventional brakes, turn the steering wheel in a controlled manner in the direction
the rear of the car is sliding. When you regain traction, straighten the vehicle and proceed slowly.
If your vehicle has an anti-lock brake system (ABS), keep your foot on the brake pedal, maintaining
firm and continuous pressure, while steering normally. Do not pump the brakes. A mechanical sound
or noise and vibration or increased resistance in the brake pedal indicates your ABS is working.

Rollover

Rollover crashes account for nearly one-third of all passenger vehicle
fatalities. You can reduce your risk of a rollover while driving:
• Avoid panicked steering– Many rollovers occur when drivers overcorrect their steering as a
panicked reaction to an emergency. At highway speeds, overcorrecting or excessive steering
can cause the driver to lose control, which can force the vehicle to slide sideways and roll over.
• Know proper maneuvering– If your vehicle leaves the roadway, do
not turn back onto the pavement right away. Ease up on the gas pedal.
When it’s safe to do so, gradually turn back onto the road.
• Maintain your tires– Improperly inflated and worn tires inhibit your ability to maintain
vehicle control, which is the most important factor in reducing the chance of rollover.
• Load vehicles properly– You can find the maximum safe load for your vehicle,
as well as proper load distribution, in your vehicle’s owner manual.
• Use caution on rural roads– Rollovers are more likely to occur on undivided, twoway roads or divided roads with no barriers. If a vehicle goes off a rural road, the
vehicle can roll over if it strikes a ditch or embankment, or is tripped by soft soil.
• Slow down on curves and ramps – Frequently advisory speeds are provided
at these locations – these advisory speeds should not be exceeded.

The rollover risk of a 15-passenger van increases dramatically as the number of occupants
increases. Other risks include inexperienced drivers, improperly sized and/or inflated tires, and
incorrectly loaded cargo and/or passengers that could affect the vehicle’s center of gravity.

FUEL ECONOMY
Fuel consumption increases steadily above 45 miles per hour, with passenger cars and light trucks
using approximately 50 percent more fuel traveling at 75 miles per hour than at 55 miles per hour.
You can maximize your fuel economy by:
• Drive more efficiently by driving sensibly, observing the speed limit, avoiding
hauling cargo on your roof and removing excess weight from your vehicle.
• Avoid rapid acceleration or sudden stops.
• Keep your vehicle in shape by properly maintaining your engine, keeping your
tires properly inflated and using the recommended grade of motor oil.
• Plan and combine trips. Your fuel economy is worse when your engine is cold than
when it is warmed up. Several short trips taken from a cold start can use twice
as much fuel as a longer, multipurpose trip covering the same distance.
42

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

TIRE PRESSURE AND TRE AD DEPTH
Tire Pressure

Tires have been known to lose up to 1 pound per square inch (psi) every month, so check
all tires, including your spare, once a month or before a long trip. Here’s how:
• Purchase a trusted pressure gauge
• Open your car door and on the inside jamb there should be a
sticker with your vehicle’s recommended psi.
• Check your tires “cold”– before you’ve driven or at least three hours after you’ve driven.
• Insert pressure gauge into the valve stem on your tire
• The gauge will “pop” out and show a measured number
• Compare the measured psi to the psi found on the sticker inside the driver’s door of your
vehicle or in owner’s manual– DO NOT compare to the psi on your tire’s sidewall
• If your psi is above the number, let air out until it matches; if below, add
air (or have a retailer help you) until it reaches the proper number

Tread Depth

Once every month, or before you embark upon a long road trip, check your tires for
wear and damage. One easy way to check for wear is by using the penny test.

1. Take a penny and hold Abraham Lincoln’s body between your thumb and forefinger
2. Select a point on your tire where the tread appears the lowest and place Lincoln’s head into
one of the grooves
If any part of Lincoln’s head is covered by the tread, you’re driving with the legal
and safe amount of tread. If your tread gets below that (approximately 1/16 of an
inch), your car’s ability to grip the road in adverse conditions is greatly reduced

DRIVING IN UNCERTAIN WE ATHER CONDITIONS
Winter Driving

Driving in winter weather presents a number of dangers due to ice, snow, and
very cold temperatures. Always clear your windows before driving.
Ice on the roadway is a potentially dangerous condition that can cause a vehicle to lose traction.

Snow, especially when mixed with significant wind, poses a number of problems for drivers. Visibility
may be substantially reduced. Watch for drifting snow, particularly in rural areas where only a few
inches of snow can cause roads to become impassable. Always watch for icy conditions, too, when
there is snowfall on the ground, particularly at intersections, and use your headlights to be seen
by other drivers. Be aware that moisture on ramps, bridges, and overpasses may occasionally
freeze before other sections of the driving roadway. Stay a safe distance behind snowplows.
Always allow your vehicle’s engine plenty of time to warm up before driving in very cold
conditions. Drive with a full tank of gas so that if stranded, the heater can remain in use
for as long as possible. Brush the snow off your headlights and taillights frequently.
Consider carrying a winter survival kit in your vehicle that includes sand or
strips of carpet for traction, booster cables, blankets, shovel, flashlight, extra
clothing, candles, matches, nonperishable snack food, and bottled water.

Rain

Wet roadway surfaces can be dangerously slick, especially immediately following
a rainfall. When you are driving on wet roads, your vehicle is actually traveling
on a thin layer of oil, dirt, and water which can lead to hydroplaning.

43

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

Hydroplaning increases with speed and at any point your tires may be in contact only with the
oil, dirt, and water. If this happens, there is no friction to brake, speed up, or turn, and a gust of
wind, a change of road level, or a slight turn can cause you to lose control of your vehicle.
Do not drive on bald or badly worn tires. Slow down when there is heavy rain, standing water, or slush on the
road. After driving through water puddles, test your brakes by pumping them. Doing so will help to dry them.
If the water is deeper than your tire treads, slow down. Use your headlights to be seen by other drivers.

Fog

Fog can greatly reduce your visibility of other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals.
Drive cautiously and at reduced speeds. Do not use high headlight beams. Low headlight
beams better illuminate the road and objects ahead. If fog closes in completely, and
visibility is reduced to near zero, carefully pull off the road as far as possible and stop.
Headlights and flashing emergency signals should be used while driving in fog.

High Winds

Strong winds have a significant effect on high-profile vehicles (e.g., vans and sport utility
vehicles). Be aware of such conditions and take appropriate action for your safety.

Flash Flooding

Flash flooding causes more deaths than any other roadway weather event each
year. Be especially alert at night or when driving on unfamiliar roads. If you are
caught in a storm or come upon a hazardous situation, follow these rules:
• Do not drive around traffic barricades or past road closed signs
• Watch for bridges, culverts, and roadbeds that may be washed away or undermined by floodwaters
• Do not drive where water is over the road, because the depth of the
water is not always obvious and the water may hide washouts
• If your car stalls in a flooded area, abandon it as soon as possible, because
flood waters can rise rapidly and sweep a car and its occupants away

DRIVING AT NIGHT
Driving at night presents a number of potential problems which can be made worse if
you do not have experience driving at night or in dangerous conditions. Drivers are more
likely to be fatigued while driving at night and may have a higher risk of accidents. Be
prepared to stop driving if you experience any signs of drowsiness listed on page 45.

Visibility

Pedestrians, road markings, and other vehicles are more difficult to identify and recognize at night.
Under nighttime driving conditions, you should reduce normal speed, especially on unfamiliar roads.

The glare of oncoming headlights may also reduce vision. To avoid glare, do not look directly
into the lights of an approaching vehicle, and instead focus on the right side of the road.

Headlights

Drivers must use headlights between sunset and sunrise as well as at any other time in which visibility
is less than 500 feet. When headlights are on, lower headlight beams must be used when approaching
within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle or when following within 200 feet of the rear of another vehicle.

44

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

IMPAIRED AND DANGEROUS DRIVING
Drowsy Driving

Driving drowsily can increase your risk for accidents. Accidents related to drowsy driving can be very
serious, leading to severe injuries or even death. Nationally, an estimated 16.5% of all fatal motor vehicle
crashes involved a fatigued driver. Studies have shown that going 18 hours without sleep leaves a driver
equally impaired to a driver with a .08 Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), which is the legal alcohol limit.

Among the most susceptible to driving while overly exhausted are shift workers, parents,
individuals taking sedative medications, and those who have an untreated sleep disorder.
Although anyone can make the fatal mistake of driving without adequate rest, young adults
age 16-29 are at the highest risk, accounting for 64 percent of fatigue-related accidents.
Be prepared to stop driving if you are unable to stay alert or experience any of the following
signs of drowsiness:
• Falling asleep at stop lights
• Yawning, rubbing eyes, watery eyes, or heavy eyelids
• Difficulty remembering the last few miles or minutes driven
• Missing road signs or exits
• Changing lanes unexpectedly
• Head nodding or dropping
• Driving off the road or hitting the rumble strips
• Failing to maintain a constant speed
If you drive while drowsy, you may become slower to respond to road and traffic conditions. You may
struggle to process complex information coming from different places at once. You may also become
careless when making driving decisions, have trouble paying attention, or actually fall asleep while driving.

How to Prevent Drowsy Driving

Do not drive if you are tired. The best way to reduce drowsiness is to get more
sleep. Pull over to a safe area as soon as you can and take a short nap.

If possible, avoid driving during times you feel sleepy. Let a well-rested person drive. Consider
carpooling, using public transportation, calling a taxi, or asking a family member or friend to drive you.

DISTR ACTED DRIVING
Driver distraction is a growing concern in Indiana and a major contributing factor in many crashes.
Distracted driving is any activity that takes your eyes off the road, hands off the steering wheel, or your
mind off of driving. Distracted driving activities include things like using a cell phone, texting, and eating.
Indiana law specifically prohibits the use of a telecommunications device, while operating a motor
vehicle. The only exceptions to this prohibition are when hands-free communication is enabled
or if the telecommunications device is being used to contact 911 for a bona fide emergency.
Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off
the road for five seconds. At 55 mph, that’s like driving the length of an entire football
field with your eyes closed. In Indiana, while driving it is illegal to text, call, or otherwise
use telecommunication devices such as cell phones unless they are hands free.

AGGRESSIVE DRIVING
Approximately one-third of all Indiana traffic fatalities occur due to “dangerous driving.” A
dangerous driving accident is any collision stemming from a driver taking one or more
of the following actions: aggressive driving, disregarding a signal, or speeding.

45

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

According to Indiana law, a person engages in aggressive driving if, during one episode of
continuous driving of a vehicle, the person does or commits at least three of the following:
• Following a vehicle too closely
• Unsafe operation of a vehicle
• Overtaking another vehicle on the right by driving off the roadway
• Unsafe stopping or slowing a vehicle
• Unnecessary sounding of the horn
• Failure to yield
• Failure to obey a traffic control device
• Driving at an unsafe speed
• Repeatedly flashing the vehicle’s headlights

DRIVING ON RUR AL ROADS
Driving on rural roads can be more hazardous than driving on a paved interstate or city street.
Rural roads may be narrower in width and consist of paved asphalt, dirt, or gravel surfaces.
Gravel– Stopping and turning is more difficult on loose gravel because your traction is reduced.
When traction is reduced, skidding can occur. You must slow down earlier to reduce your risk of
skidding through a turn or stop.
Dirt–During dry periods, dirt roads may be very dusty. The dust can reduce your visibility. Use your
low beam headlights to make yourself more visible to other drivers.
Narrow Bridges and Roads– Some bridges and roads may be narrow. You should use caution
when approaching or passing other vehicles on narrow roads or bridges. Always watch for narrow
bridge signs and be prepared to stop for other vehicles.
Steep Hills or Crests– Before approaching the crest of a steep hill, slow down, move to the right
side of the road, and watch for oncoming vehicles. Never attempt to pass another vehicle when
approaching a steep hill or crest.
Reduced Sightlines– Cultivated crops such as corn may reduce your ability to see vehicles 		
approaching intersections and oncoming vehicles on curvy roads.

DRIVING ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS
Good judgment and timing are needed to merge smoothly with fast-moving traffic on
highways. When you enter an interstate on-ramp, stay to the right and increase your speed
in the acceleration lane to allow your vehicle to merge with traffic when your path is clear.
Drivers already on the interstate should make allowances for those entering. However,
drivers entering an interstate must yield the right of way to vehicles on the interstate.
It is unsafe to back up on an interstate highway to reach a missed exit. If you miss an exit, you must
drive to the next exit. It is illegal for any vehicle, other than an emergency vehicle or a highway
maintenance vehicle, to make a U-turn by crossing the median or crossover of an interstate highway.
Except in the event of an emergency or a disabled vehicle, do not stop
or park a vehicle on the shoulder of an interstate highway.
Trucks are restricted to the right lane on sections of interstate with two lanes in one direction
and restricted to the right two lanes of interstate with three lanes or more in one direction.

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

WORK ZONES
Flashing arrow boards are often used to indicate a lane closure or “crossover.” In these
cases, lane markings on the road, traffic cones, barrels or barricades will outline the
path the vehicle must follow. A flashing arrow board not indicating a direction either way
is a signal to use caution, but does not require a driver to move to another lane.

Move or merge right

Caution

Flagger Signals

At some work sites, one or more flaggers are posted at each end of the work zone to control traffic flow.
You must stop when a flagger extends a fluorescent orange/red flag in a horizontal position into
the line of traffic. You may proceed at a reduced speed only when directed to by the flagger.
If a flagger uses a signal paddle, you must stop or proceed slowly according
to the “STOP” or “SLOW” message displayed on the sign.
In some cases, Automated Flagger Assistance Devices are used to enable the
flaggers to be positioned out of the lane of traffic. These devices display a “STOP” or
a “SLOW” sign just like the flagger-held sign paddle or use red and yellow lights.

Work Zone Safety Driving Tips

Work zones pose dangers both for drivers and for the workers. Be respectful of
these dangers and exercise caution whenever traveling in a work zone:
• Stay alert. Look for reduced speed limits, narrow driving lanes and highway workers.
• Pay attention. Work zone signs will state exactly what to expect ahead.
• Merge early. If merging at first sight of signs, traffic will generally flow more

47

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

smoothly. At some locations traffic is encouraged to merge towards the lane
closure, this is known as late or zipper merging, which may be used to reduce
the length of a traffic back-up. Signs will be used in these cases.
• Slow down. If you are speeding when you approach a work zone you
will encounter slowed or stopped traffic within seconds.
• Don’t tailgate. Maintain a safe distance on all sides of your vehicle.
• Minimize distractions.
• Plan ahead and expect delays.
• Consider taking alternate routes, if available.

R AILROAD CROSSINGS
Special signs, signals, and pavement markings are used to warn and regulate drivers at railroad
crossings, although you should not expect to see all of these devices used at every railroad crossing.
Some vehicles are required by law to always stop at railroad crossings not closer than 15 feet or
farther than 50 feet from the nearest rail. This requirement does not apply to abandoned railroad tracks
where appropriate signs have been placed or the tracks crossing the roadway have been removed.
Vehicles that must stop at railroad crossings include:
• All vehicles carrying passengers for hire
• All school buses
• All vehicles carrying explosives or flammable liquids
There are a number of warning signs used to alert drivers of a railroad crossing.

Railroad Crossing

Railroad Crossing

Railroad Crossing

Crossbucks

Crossbucks at a railroad crossing mark the location of the tracks.
When displayed alone, you should treat a crossbuck as a yield sign and the decision
to stop or cross the tracks is yours. You must stop if there is a train approaching.
When a crossbuck is displayed with a stop sign, you must come to a complete stop and
proceed over the tracks only after making certain that a train is not approaching. Never
assume that a train is not coming simply because there is only a stop sign.
When there are active warning bells, flashing lights, or lights and gates, you must
stop and not proceed until the active warning is canceled or you are directed to
proceed by a law enforcement officer or railroad flagman.

Railroad Crossing Safety

• It is illegal to drive around a crossing gate that is down.
• Obey all warning signs and devices. Due to the size of trains,
the actual speed of a train can be very deceiving. Under no
circumstances should you attempt to race a train to a crossing.
48

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

• Avoid stopping or shifting gears while crossing railroad tracks. A
driver should never begin to cross railroad tracks unless the
tracks can be cleared without stopping. If your vehicle stalls on the
tracks, all occupants should immediately leave the vehicle.
•

Look for the emergency notification sign at the crossing with contact information
to call the railroad about a blocked crossing and contact 911 for assistance.

• Watch for additional trains. Where there is more than one track, a driver
waiting for the track to clear must make sure another train is not coming
on the other track once the first train has cleared. Be careful that a train
is not proceeding in the opposite direction behind the first train.

2 TRACKS

• Be aware of ‘local quiet zones’ where locomotive horns are not
sounded by approaching trains at some gated crossings.
• Be aware that some trains operate on tracks in the middle
of streets. In those cases, traffic signals flash red in all
directions to indicate the presence of an approaching train.
Drivers should treat this indication like any other crossing warning.
• Do not pass another vehicle within 100 feet of a railroad crossing.

SAFET Y AT R AILROAD CROSSINGS
If your vehicle becomes disabled at or on a railroad crossing, or
if you observe an obstruction on the railroad tracks or at the
crossing, when a train is approaching, this may present a lifethreatening challenge for you, other motorists, or operators and
passengers on a train. Therefore, you should take immediate
action that will help minimize the result of a collision. Here is
some general guidance for you to consider if this happens:
• Once the track crossing lights begin to flash and the gate
begins to lower, you have approximately 20
seconds to escape from the crossing.
• In the event that you or another motorist are stuck on the
railroad tracks or crossing, you should evacuate the area, inform
others to do the same, and run at a 45-degree angle away
from the tracks in the direction of the oncoming train. After you
have cleared the vicinity, call 911 and report the problem.

Railroad crossing gate

If you approach a railroad crossing and your vehicle becomes disabled
on the crossing, or if you observe an obstruction on the railroad
tracks or at the crossing, but no train is approaching or present:
• Immediately call the Emergency Notification System (ENS).
The phone number is located on the blue sign attached to
the railroad track crossing gate (illustrated to the right; phone
number may be different on actual sign). Let them know
exactly what obstruction is present and your location.
• After you have notified ENS, call 911 and report the problem.

SHARING THE ROAD WITH TR ACTOR-TR AILERS
To reduce the chance of an accident with a tractor-trailer, be familiar with their braking ability, blind
spots, and maneuverability. The maximum width of any vehicle that may be operated without a special
permit is eight feet and six inches. The maximum height of any vehicle that may be operated without a
special permit is 13 feet, 6 inches. The maximum weight of any vehicle that may be operated without a
special permit is 80,000 lbs. Before moving a vehicle that exceeds the size and/or weight limits of public
highways, you must secure an oversize/overweight permit. For more information on requirements and
permits, visit IN.gov/DOR/mcs.htm. All vehicles that are over 80 inches in length must have clearance
lamps, markers, or reflectors that make the vehicle observable to other motorists at night time.
49

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

Braking

A tractor-trailer will take longer to stop than a car traveling at the same speed, and so you
should not make a sudden lane change or stop in front of a tractor-trailer. The average
passenger car traveling at 55 miles per hour can stop in approximately 130 to 140 feet, or
about half the length of a football field. A fully loaded tractor-trailer with hot brakes may take
more than 400 feet to come to a complete stop, or more than the length of a football field.

Turning

With any turning vehicle, the rear wheels follow a shorter path than the front
wheels, and the longer the vehicle is the greater the difference will be. Tractortrailer drivers often swing out as the first step in making a tight turn.
When following a tractor-trailer, watch its turn signals before trying to pass, especially to
the right. If the tractor-trailer appears to be moving to the left, wait a moment to check
and see which way the driver is signaling and watch for a right turn. When approaching
or entering a roundabout, please be mindful of the rules regarding sharing the road with
tractor-trailers. You can review those rules in the Roundabout section of this chapter.

Blind Spots

Many drivers falsely assume that a tractor-trailer driver can see the road better because he
or she sits twice as high as the driver of a car. While tractor-trailer drivers do have a better
forward view and bigger mirrors, they still have serious blind spots in which a car can completely
disappear from view. Blind spots for the tractor-trailer driver will be up to 20 feet in front of the
cab, on either side of the trailer, alongside the cab, and up to 200 feet behind the vehicle.
Drivers lingering in the blind spots on the sides and in the rear hamper a tractortrailer driver’s ability to take evasive action to avoid a dangerous situation.

Maneuverability

Tractor-trailers are designed to carry products long distances and are not designed to
be as maneuverable as cars. Tractor-trailers weigh more, have longer stopping and
accelerating distances, and have a wider turning radius. On multi-lane highways, tractortrailers stay in the center lane to help the flow of local traffic on and off the highway.
Staying in the middle lane also increases the tractor-trailer driver’s options if he or she
has to switch lanes in order to avoid a dangerous situation or an accident.

Tips for Sharing the Road with Tractor-Trailers

• Do not cut off a tractor-trailer to reach an exit or turn. Cutting into the open space
in front of a tractor-trailer removes the tractor-trailer driver’s cushion of safety. Trying to
beat a tractor-trailer to a single-lane construction zone creates a particularly dangerous
situation. Take a moment to slow down and exit behind a tractor-trailer. It will only
take you a few extra seconds and will greatly reduce the risk of an accident.
• Do not linger alongside a tractor-trailer when passing. Always pass a tractor-trailer completely
and always on the left side. If you linger when passing the tractor-trailer, your position makes it
impossible for the tractor- trailer driver to take evasive action if an obstacle appears in the road ahead.
• Do not follow too closely or tailgate. When following behind a tractor- trailer, if you cannot see the
driver’s rearview mirrors, the driver cannot see you. Tailgating a tractor-trailer is dangerous because you
take away your own cushion of safety if the tractor-trailer stops quickly. In addition, if the vehicle you are
following hits something in the road, you will have no time to react before it hits the front of your car.
• Never underestimate the size and speed of an approaching truck. Because of its large size,
a tractor-trailer often appears to be traveling at a slower speed than it is. A substantial number
of collisions involving a car and a tractor-trailer take place at intersections because the driver
of the car did not realize how close the tractor-trailer was or how quickly it was approaching.

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

SHARING THE ROAD WITH OTHER VEHICLES
Indiana’s Move Over Law

Indiana has a Move Over law (IC 9-21-8-35) that requires motorists to yield the
right of way; move over to the right and come to a complete stop; or change
lanes when approaching an emergency vehicle with its lights flashing.

Emergency Vehicles

Motorists who approach an emergency vehicle displaying alternately flashing red, red
and white, or red and blue lights are required to change lanes away from the authorized
vehicle. If you cannot move over, the motorists shall reduce their speed to 10 mph under
the posted limit and proceed with caution. Failure to comply is a Class A Infraction.

Authorized emergency vehicles identified under IC 9-13-2-6 include:
1.

Fire department vehicles

2. Police department vehicles
3. Ambulances
4.

Emergency vehicles operated by or for hospitals or health and hospital corporations.

5. Vehicles designated as emergency vehicles by the Indiana department of transportation.
6. Motor vehicles approved by the Indiana emergency medical services commission
that are: (A) ambulances that are owned by persons, firms, limited liability companies,
or corporations other than hospitals; or (B) not ambulances and that provide
emergency medical services, including extrication and rescue services.
7. Vehicles of the department of correction that are designated as
emergency vehicles and are responding to an emergency.

Authorized Parked Vehicles

Additionally, motorists who approach an authorized parked vehicle with amber
flashing lights are required to change lanes away from the authorized vehicle. If
you cannot move over, the motorists shall reduce their speed to 10 mph under the
posted limit and proceed with caution. Failure to do so is a Class B Infraction.
Authorized vehicles with amber flashing lights include:

1.

Recovery Vehicles/Tow Trucks

2. Highway Maintenance Vehicles
3. Utility Service Vehicles
4. Solid Waste Haulers/Trash Trucks
5. Survey/Construction Vehicles

School Buses

School buses are equipped with both amber and red flashing
lights. When the school bus driver activates the amber
lights, he or she is warning other drivers that the bus is
slowing and is going to load or unload children. Once the
bus stops, the red lights and stop arm will be activated.

You must stop when you approach a school bus with
flashing red lights activated and stop arm extended. If
you are driving on a roadway divided by a barrier or
unimproved median, you are required to stop only if you
are traveling in the same direction as the school bus.

51

STOP

STOP

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

The biggest threat to children who ride a bus to school is not the bus
ride, but approaching or leaving the bus. When approaching a bus stop:
• Watch for children playing or congregating near bus stops
• Be aware that children arriving late for the bus
may dart into the street without looking

STOP

STOP

• Be prepared to stop when yellow flashing lights appear on the
bus, which warn drivers the bus will be coming to a stop
Disregarding a school bus stop arm can result in a Class A
misdemeanor, a Level 6 felony if the offense results in bodily
injury, or a Level 5 felony if the offense results in death.
Take note that school buses stop at railroad crossings. Rear-end collisions involving
school buses stopped at railroad crossings have increased in recent years.

Motorcycles and Motor Driven Cycles

Motorcyclists and motor driven cycle (MDC) operators must be provided the same considerations as
passenger motor vehicle operators. Always allow all motor vehicle operators the width of a full lane.
Although it may seem as though there is enough room in the traffic lane for more than one motor
vehicle, it is important to consider that motorcyclists and MDC operators may need the full use of the
lane to maneuver safely and avoid potential hazards that are unseen by other motor vehicle operators.
The smaller profile of motorcycles and motor driven cycles can make it more difficult to judge their
speed and distance. These vehicles can also stop much more quickly than other motor vehicles.
Because of their size, motorcycles and motor driven cycles can be hidden in a vehicle’s blind spot or
missed in a quick shoulder check. Always check your mirrors and blind spots before entering or leaving
a lane of traffic and at intersections. Always signal your intentions before changing lanes or merging
with traffic. This allows other vehicle operators to anticipate traffic flow and find a safe lane position.
Do not assume that a flashing turn signal on a motorcycle or motor driven cycle
means a turn is coming soon. These vehicles have signals that are usually not selfcanceling and riders sometimes forget to turn them off. Wait to be sure the motorcyclist
or rider of a motor driven cycle is going to take action before you proceed.
Road conditions, which can be only minor annoyances to drivers of larger vehicles, can
pose major hazards to motorcyclists. Motorcyclists and riders of motor driven cycles may
change speed or adjust their position within a lane suddenly in reaction to road and traffic
conditions, such as potholes, gravel, wet or slippery surfaces, pavement seams, railroad
crossings, and grooved pavement. Allow at least three or four seconds when following a
motorcycle so the motorcyclist has enough time to maneuver or stop in an emergency.

Bicycles

Drivers must routinely share the roadway with bicyclists. On most roadways, bicyclists
have the same rights and responsibilities as other roadway users. Drivers should
observe the following guidelines when sharing the roadway with bicyclists:
• Drivers may pass a bicyclist when there is a safe amount of room beside the bicyclist
(minimum three feet) and when there is no danger from oncoming traffic
• Drivers must yield the right of way to a bicyclist just as they would to another vehicle
• Bicyclists may not ride more than two (2) abreast except on paths or
parts of roadways set aside for the exclusive use of bicycles
• A bicyclist is not required to ride in a designated bike lane because the
bicyclist has the right to use either the bike lane or the travel lane
• Avoid turning across the path of a bicyclist
• When a motorist is turning left and there is a bicyclist entering the intersection from the
opposite direction, the driver should wait for the bicyclist to pass before making the turn

52

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

• If a motorist is sharing the left turn lane with a bicyclist, stay behind
the cyclist until he or she has safely completed the left turn
• If a motorist is turning right and a bicyclist is approaching on the right, let the
bicyclist go through the intersection first before making a right turn
After parking and before opening vehicle doors, a motorist should first check for bicyclists.

Bicycle Lanes

Bicycle paths and lanes shall be used exclusively for the operation of bicycles unless:
• Signs specify joint use with pedestrians
• The driver is on official duty, such as delivering mail

Other rules for drivers or operators of any vehicle include:
• Do not drive or park in bicycle paths or lanes, or place the vehicle in a
manner that may impede bicycle traffic on such path or lane
• Yield the right of way to an individual operating a bicycle on a designated bicycle path or lane
• Do not move into a bicycle path or lane in preparation for a turn
• Cross a bicycle path or lane only when turning or when entering
or leaving an alley, driveway, or private road
• Be careful opening a car door or backing out when using on-street parking

Sharrows

Sharrow markings are pavement markings of a bike with two arrows above it
and are intended to help bicyclists position themselves away from parked cars
and to alert other road users to expect bicyclists to occupy travel lanes.

Bicycle Lane and Bus Lane Markings

Green colored pavement may be used to enhance the visibility of bike lanes.
Red colored pavement may be used to enhance the visibility of bus or transit
lanes that are designated for buses, taxis, or other modes of public transit.

Sharrow Markings

Slow-Moving Vehicles

Certain slow-moving farm vehicles, construction equipment, and vehicles
drawn by animals may share roadways. You should use care when
approaching and passing these vehicles. Be alert for the special emblem
that the driver must place on the rear of the slow-moving vehicle.

A rider of a horse or horse-drawn vehicle has the same rights and responsibilities of a
motor vehicle driver when riding on a public highway. Approach with caution and be alert
for any hand signals used by a horseback rider or the driver of a horse-drawn vehicle.

Stationary Utility, Maintenance, and Solid Waste Vehicles

Slow Moving
Vehicle

When you see stationary utility, construction, maintenance, recovery, survey, or solid waste
vehicles that are displaying alternating flashing amber lights, you should slow down and
move into a lane that is not adjacent to the vehicle if it is possible to do so safely. If you are
traveling on a highway containing at least four lanes, with no fewer than two lanes proceeding

53

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

in your direction of travel, you must slow down and move into a lane that is not adjacent to
the vehicle if it is possible to do so safely. If it is not possible to change lanes safely, you must
slow down to 10 miles per hour below the posted speed limit and proceed with caution.

Traffic Control Officers and Official Processions

Because of special events, traffic congestion, or other reasons, a law enforcement officer may direct traffic
at an intersection. A law enforcement officer’s command may be different from a traffic signal or sign. In
such a case, the law enforcement officer’s command is the one that must be obeyed. Official processions,
such as a funeral procession, have the right of way regardless of a traffic signal that indicates otherwise.

PARKING AND REVERSING
Parallel Parking

Follow these procedures to parallel park in an empty space that
has vehicles parked in front of it and behind it:

1.

Signal your intention to park.

2. Position your vehicle parallel with the vehicle parked in front of the empty space
and maintain at least two feet from this vehicle. Align your rear bumper with the
rear bumper of the vehicle parked in front of the empty space (Figure A).
3. Reverse slowly until the front of the vehicle is even with the front door of
the parallel car. Turn the wheel sharply to the right and reverse slowly until
the vehicle is at a 45-degree angle, and reverse (Figure B).
4.

When the front of your vehicle passes the rear of the parallel car, turn your steering
wheel to the left sharply, then gradually, while backing into the space (Figure C).

5. Straighten your vehicle’s wheels and pull forward in the space (Figure D).

Figure D

Figure C

Figure B

Figure A

When you park facing downhill, turn your vehicle’s wheels toward the curb.
When you park facing uphill, turn your vehicle’s wheels away from the curb. If
there is no curb, turn your vehicle’s wheels away from the street.
Use your turn signal when entering traffic from a parking space. Be sure to look in both
directions and double-check for cars and pedestrians when backing out of a parking place.

Illegal Parking Areas

Parking in the following common areas is prohibited:
• Highways (unless indicated otherwise)
• Within intersections or on pedestrian crosswalks
• On sidewalks or in front of any driveway
• Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant or in fire lanes
• Bridges or other elevated structures, such as on a highway or a tunnel
• Adjacent to yellow curbs
• Beside another parked vehicle
• Parking spots reserved for those with disabilities unless in possession of a valid parking placard
• Diagonally striped area next to accessible parking spaces
54

CHAPTER 7 | Safe Vehicle Operation

Reversing

Reversing is more difficult than driving forward because your field of vision is blocked
by the vehicle itself, and it is more difficult to control your speed and direction.

To reverse, turn your body to the right to look through the back window. Never
use only the rearview mirror for reversing. Go slowly, watching carefully in all
directions. Never back into an intersection in order to turn around.

Handicap Accessible Parking

Reserved parking spots for those with disabilities
are marked with a sign and pavement markings.

Parking in the diagonally striped area next to an
accessible parking space is prohibited. This striped
space allows a wheelchair user to transfer in and out
of his or her vehicle. If the wheelchair user has an
accessible vehicle, this space is required to deploy its
ramp so the wheelchair user can safely enter and exit
the vehicle. Parking in this striped area is prohibited
even if you are in possession of a valid parking placard.

PEDESTRIAN SAFET Y
Crosswalks or a pedestrian signal indicate that pedestrians are nearby. Follow
these rules or guidelines when pedestrians are in the vicinity:
• Always yield the right of way to pedestrians
• Do not make a turn that causes a pedestrian to stop, slow down, or
make some other special effort to avoid a collision
• If children are in the vicinity, take special care because children are not fully aware of the
dangers of traffic. Children and other pedestrians may cross at unexpected places.
• Be respectful of others who have difficulty crossing streets, such
as elderly persons or someone with a visual disability
• Everyone is a pedestrian

Visually Impaired Pedestrians

Traveling aids for a person who is visually impaired are often a white cane or a trained guide
dog. Independent travel for people with visual disabilities involves some risk that can be
greatly reduced when drivers are aware of the use and meaning of a white cane or guide
dog. Drivers must always yield the right of way to persons who are visually impaired.

SE AT BELTS AND CHILD SAFET Y RESTR AINTS
Seat belts and child safety restraints, such as car seats, save thousands of lives each year and improve
the chances of surviving an accident. When worn, seat belts for drivers and front-seat passengers
increase the chance of survival by 45 percent and cut the risk of serious injury by 50 percent.

Seat Belts

Indiana law requires a driver and all passengers to use seat belts at all times when a
vehicle is in operation. Operators of buses are also required to use a seat belt.

A seat belt must be used even in a vehicle with one or more air bags. Air bags are
designed to work in tandem with seat belts to slow down the vehicle’s occupants in the
event of a collision. Failure to use a seat belt could result in injury from the air bag.

55

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

To maximize safety, follow these tips to ensure that you and your passengers are sitting properly
in your vehicle:
• Everyone should wear their seat belts low on the hips and flat across the collar bone.
• Driver should sit at least 12 inches away from the steering wheel.
• Head restraints should be positioned so they are higher than the top
and as close as possible to the back of an individual’s head.

Seat Belt Exemptions

The following are examples of when seat belts are not required:
• Drivers or passengers who should not wear a seat belt for medical reasons, provided
they have written documentation of the medical reasons from a physician
• A child who is required to be restrained by a child restraint system
• Traveling in a commercial or United States Postal Service vehicle that makes
frequent stops for the purpose of pickup or delivery of goods and services
• A rural carrier of the United States Postal Service who is operating a vehicle while serving a rural postal route
• A newspaper motor route carrier or newspaper bundle hauler who stops to make deliveries from a vehicle
• A driver examiner designated and appointed by the BMV who is conducting an examination
of an applicant for a learner’s permit or driver’s license under IC 9-24-10
• An occupant of a farm truck being used on a farm in connection with agricultural
pursuits that are usual and normal to the farming operations
• An occupant of a motor vehicle participating in a parade
• An occupant of the living quarters area of a recreational vehicle
• An occupant of the treatment area of an ambulance
• An occupant of the sleeping area of a tractor trailer
• An occupant, other than the operator, of a municipal waste collection and transportation vehicle
• An occupant, other than the operator, of a truck on a construction site
• A passenger, other than the operator, in a cab of a recovery vehicle, who is being transported
in the cab because the passenger’s vehicle is being towed by the recovery vehicle
• An occupant, other than the operator, of a motor vehicle being used by a public utility in an emergency

Child Safety Restraints

Passengers younger than eight years of age are required by law to be properly
secured in a child restraint system such as a child car seat or booster seat.

Passenger Air Bags

The explosive power of air bags has killed children and elderly adults less than five feet
tall. If a car is equipped with an air bag on the passenger side, the National Safety Council
recommends putting children younger than 12 years of age in the back seat.

TRUCK EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
The lighting requirements for any truck or bus are: (2) red tail lamps, one (1)
rear white license plate lamp, and at least one (1) red stop-lamp.
Vehicles transporting loads extending farther than four feet beyond the rear of
the motor vehicle, or which have tailboards or tailgates extending farther than
four feet beyond the vehicle, must have the following projections visible:
• One red lamp must be mounted at the extreme rear end of the vehicle’s load between sunset and sunrise.
The red lamp must be mounted and visible from both sides and the rear at a distance of 500 feet.
• One red flag must be mounted at the extreme rear end of vehicle’s load between
sunrise and sunset. The red flag must be mounted, must be not less than 12 square
inches, and must be visible from both sides and the rear of the vehicle.

Vehicular Hazard Warning Flashing Lamps

Every bus, truck, and tractor-trailer must be equipped with a signaling system. In addition to signaling
turning movements, these vehicles must have a switch or combination of switches that cause the
two front turn signals and the two rear signals to flash simultaneously as a vehicular traffic signal
warning. The signal must be capable of flashing simultaneously with the ignition on or off.

Warning Devices for Stopped Vehicles

If your car becomes disabled, even if you can pull off onto the shoulder, you must be visible to other
drivers for their safety and yours. The disabled vehicle’s hazard lights, if available, should be turned on.

Whenever headlights are required on a divided highway, such precautions as a lighted
fuse, a lighted red electric lantern, or a portable red emergency reflector must be placed
100 feet behind your car and 100 feet in front, in the center of the lane occupied by your
vehicle. Additionally, one of these signals must be placed at the traffic side of the vehicle and
approximately ten (10) feet from the vehicle in the direction of the nearest approaching traffic.
In the daytime, drivers of disabled cars must display two red flags: one approximately 100 feet in front
of the car and the other approximately 100 feet behind it. If your car is stopped within 500 feet of a
curve, hilltop, or other obstruction, a warning device must be displayed at least 500 feet from your car.
A driver of a truck, bus, or tractor-trailer that is disabled on a traveled roadway or its shoulder must
display three bi-directional emergency reflective triangles which conform to the requirements of
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 125, or at least six fuses or three liquid-burning flares.
Place a lighted flare or fuse, lighted red electric lantern, or portable red emergency reflector
on the traffic side of the vehicle in the direction of the nearest approaching traffic.
Place one device approximately 100 feet from your vehicle toward approaching traffic. Place one
device approximately 100 feet from your vehicle in the opposite direction. Place each device in the
center of the traffic lane occupied by the disabled vehicle and one at the traffic side of the vehicle.
If your vehicle is disabled on a divided highway, the device must be 200 feet from your vehicle.
If your vehicle is disabled within 500 feet of a curve, hill crest, or other area where a driver’s
view of your vehicle may be blocked, place the device at least 500 feet from your vehicle.
During times when headlights are not needed, use such warning signals as bi-directional
emergency reflective triangles or red flags in place of flares, reflectors, or electric lanterns.
Under these conditions, no flare is required on the traffic side of the disabled vehicle.

CHAPTER EIGHT | ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
Among all collisions in Indiana, failure to yield the right of way is the most common factor. Accidents are
often caused by a driver’s lack of attention, a driver’s failure to observe the rules of the road, or both.

WHAT TO DO AFTER AN ACCIDENT
Legal Requirements of Drivers Involved in an Accident

Drivers, passengers, and pedestrians could be injured in an accident at any time or place
on or along a roadway. Knowing what to do after an accident can make the experience
less frightening and decrease the chance of unnecessary complications.

Should You Move Your Vehicle?

The driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident must stop immediately or as close as possible
to the scene of the accident without obstructing traffic more than necessary. If the accident occurs
on the traveled portion of a highway, the driver must move the vehicle off the highway to a location
as close to the accident as possible. However, the driver should not move the motor vehicle if the
accident involves the transportation of hazardous materials or results in injury, death, or entrapment.
The driver must remain at the scene of the accident, giving their name, address, and registration
number of the motor vehicle to everyone involved, in addition to showing his or her driver’s license.

Provide Reasonable Assistance

In the event the accident results in the injury or death of another person, the driver is required
to provide reasonable assistance to those injured or trapped in vehicles as directed by law
enforcement, medical personnel or a 911 operator. As soon as possible, the driver should make
sure law enforcement (local police, sheriff, or state police) are notified of the accident.
If the collision was with an unattended vehicle or other property, the driver must stop and remain at
the scene of the accident, take reasonable steps to notify the owner of the damaged property, and
if the owner cannot be located, call a law enforcement agency in order to provide information.

Provide Proof of Financial Responsibility (Certificate of Compliance)

After an accident and upon request from the BMV, you will be required to provide proof of financial
responsibility to the BMV. Your insurance provider must electronically file proof of financial
responsibility in the form of a Certificate of Compliance (COC). The COC will demonstrate that
you held an effective motor vehicle insurance policy that meets the state’s minimum liability
protection during that accident. If you receive a request for financial responsibility verification
from the BMV, do not delay in asking your insurance provider to electronically send a COC to
the BMV on your behalf. For more information on Financial Responsibility, see Chapter 5.

AVOIDING COLLISIONS
Despite safe driving, emergencies do arise. If it appears that a car will hit
something, there are three things you can do, depending on the situation:
Stop quickly.
Turn quickly. If you feel you cannot stop in time, turn your vehicle away from the potential collision.
Speed up. Accelerating may sometimes be the best or only way to avoid a collision.
If a collision looks possible, turn away from oncoming traffic, even if it means leaving the road.
Drive, rather than skid, off the road, allowing for more control. Choose to hit something that will
give way, such as brush or shrubs, rather than something hard. Hit something moving in the same
direction as you rather than something that is not moving. However, it is safer to hit something
that is not moving than to hit something head-on. A sideswipe may help you slow down.

Driving off the Pavement

If your vehicle’s wheels drift onto the shoulder of the road, do not try to turn back onto the

58

CHAPTER 8 | Accidents and Emergency Situations

pavement right away. This action might throw your vehicle off balance. Instead, drive along the
shoulder and ease up on the gas pedal. After slowing down, turn back onto the road gradually.

Plunging into Water

If a vehicle plunges into water, it will usually float several minutes before sinking, allowing
a driver or occupants to escape through an open window, while still on the surface.
If your vehicle plunges into water, do not attempt to open a door. The weight of the water will make it
nearly impossible to open a door and water will flood the passenger compartment through an open door.
Follow these guidelines if your vehicle plunges into water:
• Remove your seat belt.
• Open a window. Automatic windows will open unless the impact
is so severe that it damages the electrical system.
• Get children out of rear seat belts and child restraints, asking older children to assist
the younger ones. Move passengers to the front seats as calmly as possible.
• Exit the vehicle and move to the roof. This will keep you as dry as possible and even in moving water you
can ride the vehicle like a boat for a short time. Once on the roof, call 911 and locate the nearest dry land.
• Swim for shore only as a last resort. If emergency personnel or other assistance has not
arrived by the time your vehicle sinks below the waterline, you may be forced to swim.
• Never re-enter the vehicle to gather possessions.

IMPAIRED DRIVING
The likelihood of an accident increases if a driver is under the influence of drugs and
alcohol. Alcohol negatively affects your brain’s ability to think clearly and your physical
coordination, and it increases your reaction time. The primary factors in determining
an individual’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are the amount of alcohol consumed,
how quickly the alcohol is consumed, and the individual’s body weight.
Many prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and other recreational drugs will also
impair your reasoning and coordination. Using these drugs may have a negative effect on
your ability to operate a motor vehicle in a safe manner. Always consult the label on any
medication and discuss its side effects with a physician or pharmacist before driving.
For more information about motor vehicle law pertaining to operating a vehicle
while intoxicated, see the Chapter 5 section on suspensions.

Ways to Spot an Impaired Driver

A car can be a lethal weapon when operated by a driver impaired by
drugs or alcohol. A driver may be impaired if the vehicle:
• Makes wide turns
• Straddles the center line or weaves back and forth
• Exceeds the speed limit or drives unusually slowly
• Comes close to hitting another vehicle or object
• Swerves, drifts, or follows too closely
• Stops for no reason or turns abruptly or illegally
• Signals inconsistently or drives at night without headlights.

ROADSIDE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
A roadside emergency is a serious situation that will take you and other motorists by surprise. The
following safety guidelines, while not necessarily required by Indiana law, will help you get back
on the road and alert other motorists that you are managing a roadside emergency situation.

59

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

• If possible, always pull your vehicle onto the roadside shoulder.
• Turn on your flashing hazard lights.
• Keep a flashlight with fresh batteries within reach of the vehicle operator.
• Store a reflective safety vest and red emergency reflective triangle in your
vehicle so that you are more visible to other motorists passing by you.
• Your red emergency reflective triangle should be placed 200 feet behind your
vehicle, or 500 feet behind your vehicle if you are on a hill or curve.
• During winter months, pack blankets, extra gloves, and warm hats in your vehicle
in case you must wait for emergency responders or a vehicle tow.
• If you must exit the vehicle while on a roadside shoulder, exit the vehicle on
the passenger side and only after checking your immediate vicinity for other
motor vehicles, obstructions, or dangerous drop-offs or inclines.

VEHICLE EQUIPMENT FAILURES
Tire Blowout

In a situation with a flat tire or blowout, you should hold the steering wheel firmly and keep the car
going straight. Slow down gradually. Take your foot off the gas pedal, but do not apply the brakes.
Let the car slow down, pull off the road and then apply the brakes when the car is almost stopped.

Brake Failure

If your vehicle’s conventional disc or drum brakes suddenly fail, you should shift to a lower gear, if possible,
and pump the brake pedal fast and hard several times. This may build up enough brake pressure to
stop your vehicle. You may try to use the parking brake, but hold the brake release so it can be released
to avoid skidding if the rear wheels lock. With your vehicle in a low gear, begin looking for a place to
stop off the roadway. After your vehicle has stopped, call for help, but do not try to drive anywhere.

Ignition Locking

Drivers in an emergency situation on the highway should not try to turn off the vehicle
while it is still moving. When operating a vehicle with a steering wheel interlock system,
never turn the ignition to the lock position while the vehicle is in motion. The steering
will lock as the steering wheel is turned, causing a loss of control of the vehicle.

AVOIDING VEHICLE THEFT
By taking the following precautions, the chances of having a vehicle stolen may be reduced:
• Remove keys
• Always lock a vehicle’s doors
• Do not hide a second set of keys in or around the vehicle
• Park with front wheels turned sharply to the right and apply the emergency brake
• Never leave a vehicle unattended with the engine running
• Consider installing an anti-theft device
• Park in well-lit, well-patrolled areas whenever possible

TR AFFIC STOPS BY L AW ENFORCEMENT
Traffic stops create unknown risk and can be stressful for both the police officer and motorist.
The purpose of the traffic stop is to ensure that a vehicle operator is safe and in compliance
with the law. For the safety of vehicle operator, passengers, and law enforcement officers,
drivers stopped by law enforcement should adhere to the following suggestions:
• Acknowledge the officer’s presence by turning on your right turn signal. Activating
your signal lets the officer know that you recognize their presence. Based on their
training, if you fail to acknowledge them by turning on your turn signal, an officer might
perceive that you have a reason to avoid yielding or that you might be impaired.
60

CHAPTER 8 | Accidents and Emergency Situations

• Move your vehicle to the right side shoulder of the road. The officer will guide you
using their patrol vehicle. Do not move onto the center median. Do not stop in the center
median of a freeway or on the opposite side of a two-lane roadway. This can place both
the driver and the officer in danger of being hit by oncoming traffic. If there is no shoulder
or it is too narrow to pull over, you should find the next safest location and pull over.
• Immediately pull over when able in a safe manner. Stop in a well-lit area when possible.
Pull your vehicle as far off the roadway as possible. When it is dark, look for locations that have
more light, such as areas with street or freeway lights, near restaurants, or service stations. If
you are being stopped at night, you are encouraged to turn on the interior light of the vehicle.
• If you cannot find a safe place immediately, slow down and turn on
hazard lights. This indicates to the officer that you acknowledge his/
her presence and are actively trying to find a safe place to stop.
• End your cell phone conversation and turn off your radio. The officer needs your full attention
to communicate with you to complete the enforcement stop in the least amount of time needed.
• Remain inside your vehicle unless otherwise directed by the officer. Never step out
of your vehicle, unless an officer directs you to do so. During an enforcement stop, the
officer’s priorities are your safety, the safety of your passengers, and the officer’s own
personal safety. In most situations, the safest place for you and your passengers is inside
your vehicle. Exiting your vehicle without first being directed by an officer can increase the
risk of being struck by a passing vehicle and/or cause the officer to feel threatened.
• The driver and all passengers should place their hands in clear view. The driver should
keep their hands on the steering wheel and passenger hands should be visible on their
laps. During an enforcement stop, an officer’s inability to see the hands of the driver and
of all occupants in the vehicle can cause the officer to feel threatened. If your windows are
tinted, it is recommended that you roll down all of your windows after you have stopped your
vehicle on the right shoulder of the roadway and before the officer makes contact with you.
• Comply with the officer’s request to see documentation. Vehicle operators are
required to have a valid driver’s license, registration, and insurance in order to operate a
vehicle. If these items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance
is stored for display on a cellphone, you should first inform the police officer of that fact
and then follow the officer’s directions before reaching to retrieve the information.
• If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest, you:
» Should not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
» Should not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver’s signature. Signing a
ticket is not an admission of the driver’s guilt, but only an acknowledgment of receiving the ticket.
» Should not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If a driver
is suspected of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood, or
performance tests can result in the loss of driving privileges.
» Should not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance. If a driver
believes an offense was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, he/
she will have the opportunity to present the case in traffic court.
» Should not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.
» A driver is to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers. If you believe
that an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter, you should
report the conduct as soon as possible after the encounter to the officer’s superiors. Officers
are required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints
can be filed with the agency’s internal affairs division or civilian complaint board. Regardless
of what action is taken, police officers are legally required to document all traffic stops,
which includes obtaining the driver’s name and address for data collection purposes.

CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING
Carbon monoxide gas from a vehicle engine can harm or kill you or your passengers. Carbon
monoxide is most likely to leak into a vehicle when its heater is running, when the exhaust
system is not working properly, or in heavy traffic where exhaust fumes are breathed in from
other vehicles. A faulty exhaust system can leak poisonous fumes into a vehicle’s back seat.
You cannot see, smell, or taste carbon monoxide. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can include
drowsiness or dizziness, a bluish tinge to your skin or lips, a headache, and increased sensitivity to light.

How to Avoid Carbon Monoxide Poisoning

• Have your vehicle’s exhaust system checked regularly
• Be alert for any unusual roar from under the car
• Never let your vehicle’s engine run in a closed garage
• In congested traffic, close the fresh-air vent
• On highways in cold weather, open the fresh-air vent

APPENDIX B | TEENS BEHIND THE WHEEL
DRIVER GUIDE FOR PARENTS AND TEENS
The Driver Guide for Parents and Teens is posted on IN.gov/BMV. It is an important tool
that can be used to help keep parents engaged in their child’s driver education.

Risk Factors for Teens

• Errant and Risky Driving. Errant and risky driving and distraction
is the most common contributing factor in teen crashes.
• Inattentiveness. Driver inattention and distraction is a common
contributing factor in multiple-vehicle crashes.
• Excessive speed. Illegal or unsafe speed is a common contributing factor in single vehicle
crashes. Teens may have difficulty adjusting their speed to suit current driving conditions.
Higher speeds reduce the time a driver has to recognize and react to hazards.
• Driving with other teens. The chance of a crash doubles with each passenger present in the vehicle.
• Failure to wear a seat belt. Wearing a seat belt is not just the law, but is
also the best way to reduce the chance of injury or death in a crash.
• Being inattentive at intersections. Most multi-vehicle crashes
involving teens occur at intersections. Teen drivers need to be free from
distractions and focused on other vehicles at intersections.
• Use of alcohol or other drugs while driving. While the percentage of teen drivers
who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs is small, they account for a much higher
percentage of serious injury and death from crashes involving all teen drivers.

Tips for Teen Drivers

• You and your passengers must always wear seat belts.
• Always adjust your seats and mirrors for the best visibility before starting each drive.
• Do not adjust your radio while you are driving. It is better to wait until you are stopped
because taking your focus off the road for even a few seconds could lead to a collision.
• Do not play music loudly. You might miss hearing a siren or a horn that could warn
you of possible trouble.
• Do not talk on the phone or text while driving--it’s against the law. Do not eat, comb
your hair, put on makeup, or do anything else that distracts you from driving.

69

INDIANA DRIVER’S MANUAL | IN.gov/BMV

• Do not drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol or ride with anyone who is
under the influence. Even some over-the-counter drugs can make you drowsy.
• Before entering an intersection, make sure the intersection is clear before you proceed.
• Obey all traffic signals. Always be prepared to stop as you approach an intersection with
a green light in case the light changes. Unless you are already in an intersection when
the light turns yellow, you should not enter the intersection after the light turns yellow.
• Obey the speed limit. Going too fast gives you less time to stop or react.

Tips for Parents of Teens

• When you drive, set a good example for your teen.
• Require seat belt use at all times.
• Practice driving with your teen while he or she has a learner’s
permit and during the first year of licensed driving.
• Expose your teen to different driving conditions, including wet roads, snow, highways,
rural roads, night driving, etc.
• Practice driving on unfamiliar roads.
• Choose vehicles for safety, not image.
• Take the necessary time to discuss driving rules, responsibilities, and consequences appropriate
for your family.
• Develop a strategy for progressive privileges. As the teen driver gains experience and demonstrates
appropriate decisions, allow your teen to move up to a higher level of driving responsibility.
• Developing necessary skills for safe driving is a complex task and can be learned only through
practice. Driver education is a first step, but parents have a crucial role in teaching
teens to drive.

Operating Off-Road Vehicles (ORV)

Anyone under 18 years of age who is operating or riding an ORV shall wear a helmet that meets the
standards established by the United States Department of Transportation under 49 CFR 571.218.
A person who is
• The owner of an ORV;
• In possession of an ORV; or
• Entitled to the possession of an ORV, whether by reason of legal title, lease, license, rental

APPENDIX C | OTHER BMV SERVICES AND RESOURCES
Forms

Forms are available on IN.gov/BMV or at any BMV branch.

Application for Voter Registration

Any individual obtaining a new, renewed, replacement, or amended credential may also apply
to register to vote if that individual is eligible to vote. This may be done when completing a
credential transaction at a BMV branch, on myBMV.com, or at a BMV Connect kiosk. Mail-in voter
registration forms are available for people who are not at the branch for credential transactions.

Military Selective Service Registration

Indiana law requires the BMV, when authorized by a male younger than 26 years of age who
is getting a new or renewed driver’s license, to submit the necessary information to the federal
government to register that individual with the Selective Service system. Failure to register
is a felony and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
Î Selective Service registration is required for citizens of the United States.
