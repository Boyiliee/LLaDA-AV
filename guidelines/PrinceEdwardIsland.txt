Letter from the Minister
The purpose of this Driver’s Handbook is to help you with the skills to prevent against collisions and injury
to you and others on our roads. Driving is a privilege and as a driver, you have a responsibility to contribute to
the overall safety of Island roads.
By following the safe driving practices in this book you will reduce the risk to yourself and to others on our
roads. New drivers will want to study the Driver’s Handbook and experienced drivers will find it a convenient
reference for refreshing their knowledge.
Driving conditions are often affected by things beyond your control. Changing weather, road conditions and
mechanical failures are just a few examples. Other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists also make use of our roads
and must be respected by drivers. Remember, as a new driver, safer roads begin with you.
Thank you,
The Minister
Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal

Class 5 Driver’s Licence
Checklist Form

C h a p t e r 1 : Your Driver’s Licence
INTRODUCTION
There are a number of things you should know about
your Driver’s Licence and you should read this section
very carefully so that you will understand them.
You need a valid Driver’s Licence to drive a motor
vehicle in Prince Edward Island. It must not be expired,
suspended, cancelled or invalidated. Your Driver’s
Licence gives you the privilege of driving only as long
as you are careful, considerate and obey the traffic
laws; otherwise, it will be suspended.
Drivers’ licences are valid only for the operation of the
class(es) of the vehicle(s) shown on the licence and
are always subject to any restrictions shown on the
licence.
WHO MAY APPLY FOR AN INSTRUCTION PERMIT
If you are 16 years of age or older, you may apply for
an Instruction Permit if your driving privilege is not

3

under suspension. An Instruction Permit will allow
you to operate a motor vehicle under supervision to
receive instruction. The Instruction Permit is called
a Stage 1 or Class 7 licence and is valid for two years
from date of issue.
DOCUMENTS REQUIRED
Every person applying for a first Instruction Permit,
or Driver’s Licence, must produce a birth certificate,
passport, or Immigration papers before a Driver’s
Licence or Instruction Permit will be issued.
If your previous address was outside of Canada, you
must show your Canadian Immigration Identification
Record of Entry form when you apply. The PEI
Association for Newcomers to Canada can assist you
with the translation of your home country’s Driver’s
Licence. There may be a fee for this service.

4
In addition, Acceptable Residency/Address
Information is required. Two pieces of the following
must be shown:
• current utility bills (electric, cable, phone,etc)
• formal rental or lease agreement
• letter of employment on company letterhead or
pay stub with name and address
• mail from Federal or Provincial Government (tax,
GST, correspondence, etc.)
• bank cheque with name and address
• mortgage documents
• credit card bill/bank statement
All of the above must have a name and current Prince
Edward Island address.
INSTRUCTION PERMIT (CLASS 7)
If you are a beginning driver and have reached 16
years of age, you may apply for an Instruction Permit.
To get this permit you must:

Chapter 1: Your Driver’s L i c e n c e
• study this Driver’s Handbook carefully;
• make an appointment for your written test and pay
the applicable fee;
• appear at the Highway
Safety office in your
area for written and
sign-recognition tests
based on the Driver’s

• if you are less than 18 years of age,
have your application approved by your parents or
legal guardians by their signing the parents’ consent
form found in the “Co-Pilot” brochure, and present
this consent form along with a birth certificate.
The parents or legal guardian may withdraw such
consent and if notice of withdrawal is given in
writing to the registrar, the permit or licence will be
cancelled at once;

C h a p t e r 1 : Your Driver’s Licence
• complete a vision test conducted by Highway
Safety Staff; and
• pay Permit Fee.
Driver education schools conduct the Instruction
Permit (Class 7) tests as well as the Driver’s Licence
(Class 5) road tests.
GRADUATED DRIVER LICENSING RESTRICTIONS:
Congratulations! You now have your Instruction
Permit (Class 7, Stage 1) and have become part of
the Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) Program. The
following restrictions apply:
• You may drive a motor vehicle only when a licensed
driver, who has held a Driver’s Licence for at least
four years, and who does not have a blood alcohol
count of 0.05 or more, occupies the seat beside you.
• The only passengers permitted in the vehicle are the
person providing the instruction and that person’s
immediate family.

• If you are enrolled in a driver education program,
you may take your first road test after waiting 275
days. If you are not enrolled in a driver education
program, you must wait 365 days before taking a
road test.
• Drivers in the GDL Program must have zero blood
alcohol content (BAC).
• Law enforcement has the explicit authority to ask to
see the driver’s licence of the individual providing
the instruction.
• The vehicle operated by the beginner must display
a decal on the vehicle that identifies the operator of
the vehicle as a beginner. (The decal is bright yellow
in colour with a black letter L which is placed just
above the Motor Vehicle Inspection sticker.) It is
made of a material that allows it to be removed so it
can be placed on other vehicles.
• Drivers in the GDL Program may not drive between
the hours of 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. This does not apply to

6

Chapter 1: Your Driver’s L i c e n c e

individuals who have an Instruction Permit (Class 7)

• Any violation that results in demerit points will
result in the suspension of the Instruction Permit
(Class 7).
• Any conviction you receive for failure to wear a seat
belt while you are in the GDL Program will result
in the suspension of your driver’s licence. The first
offence will result in a suspension of 30 days and
second offence will result in a suspension of 90 days.
In addition, while you are in the GDL Program, and
any passenger fails to wear a seat belt, you may be
issued a fine.

Certification Program. You may be required to have
a second road test during your newly licensed driver
probationary period. There is no fee for this evaluation

and it will be conducted by a Highway Safety
examiner.

been certified by your driver education instructor. You
will be issued an Instruction Permit valid for two years.

STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A DRIVER EDUCATION
COURSE
If you are a beginning driver enrolled in a licensed
Driver Education Program, to receive your Instruction
Permit (Class 7) you need to:
• successfully complete the written examinations at
an authorized driving school;
• go to the Highway Safety/Access PEI office in your
area for a vision test; and
• if you are less than 18 years of age, have your
application approved by your parents or legal
guardians by their signing the parents’ consent
form found in the “Co-Pilot” brochure, and present
this consent form along with a birth certificate.
Once you have passed the written and vision exams,
you will get an Instruction Permit (Class 7) that has

DRIVER EDUCATION PASSENGER RESTRICTIONS
• During this time the holder of an instruction
permit is accompanied by a licensed instructor
giving instruction to persons enrolled in a
recognized motor vehicle driver instruction course
and no more than four persons not including the
instructor are in the motor vehicle.
• You may also operate a motor vehicle if a licensed
operator, who has held a valid Driver’s Licence for at
least four years, occupies the seat beside you, and
no other people, except members of the immediate
family of the licensed driver, are allowed in the
vehicle.
• You must wait a minimum 275 days before a road
test can be conducted by the driving school for 		
certification of a Class 5 Driver’s Licence.

Chapter 1: What the Tests Are All About

• When you successfully complete the road test by
the driver education school instructor, you must
return to the Highway Safety/Access PEI office to get
your photo Driver’s Licence.
NOTE:
The Instruction Permit (Class 7) is not a Class 5 Driver’s
Licence. It remains an Instruction Permit until a
photo driver licence has been issued. You must get
your Class 5 photo licence within 30 days after you
successfully complete the road test. If you do not,
you may have to be retested by a Highway Safety
examiner and pay the appropriate fees.
These tests are to protect the general public from
incapable drivers. They are not designed to keep you
off the road but to point out areas where you
can improve. The tests represent the minimum
requirements for safe and courteous driving practices.

Passing the tests does not guarantee that you will
never become involved in a collision. As the number of
cars on the road increases, the risk of collision
increases. There are many traffic signs and controls
that you must recognize and obey. Driving makes
great demands on drivers. You must be skillful, alert
and always practise care, caution and courtesy.
THE KNOWLEDGE TEST
You will take a written or oral test which examines
your knowledge of traffic laws and safe driving
practices. This test includes recognition of standard
road signs. All of this information can be found in this
handbook.
If you can’t read and understand the written test, you
may ask for an oral test. You will be asked about the
rules of the road and safe driving practices,
recognition of road signs by their shape, and your

Chapter 1: What the Tests Are All About
ability to read and understand the meaning of the
signs. If you do not successfully complete the written
or oral test, you may make an appointment and take
another test at a later date.
THE VISION TEST
You must meet certain vision
standards. If you cannot meet these
standards, you may be referred to an
eye specialist (ophthalmologist or
optometrist) to have the findings
checked. If you cannot meet the
vision standards without the aid of
corrective lenses (glasses or contact
lenses), you must obtain and wear corrective lenses
while driving. Your Instruction Permit and Driver’s
Licence will contain a condition allowing you to drive
a motor vehicle only while wearing corrective lenses.
You will also be given:
• a colour vision test;

9

• a distance judgment test; and
• a field of vision test.
Any deficiencies uncovered by these tests will be
carefully explained to you so that you can compensate
for them in your driving. For example, if you are colour
blind, you will have to learn the relative positions of
the traffic signal lights. You will also have to exercise
greater care when visibility is poor and certain
coloured cars may blend into the background, making
them invisible to you.
If your field of vision is very narrow, you may be
refused a licence until the defect is corrected. In some
cases you may get a licence if your vehicle is equipped
with mirrors which give the driver a clear view to
the rear and both sides. In this case your licence will
restrict you to driving with this kind of equipment at
all times. If you cannot meet the minimum vision
standard, even with glasses, you will be refused a
licence.

Chapter 1: What the Tests Are All About

THE NOVICE DRIVER COURSE
If you have an Instruction Permit (Class 7), you must
complete the Novice Driver Course before you are
eligible for a road test. This material is covered in
the classroom component of the Driver Education
Program. It is the beginning of the most important
stage of your driving experience - learning how to
operate a motor vehicle properly and safely.
The Novice Driver Course
explains:
• the Graduated Driver
Licensing Program;
• the demerit point system;
• impaired driving aspects
of the Criminal Code;
• alcohol and drug education; and
• how to handle certain driving conditions.
The course lasts about five hours and is usually taught

in two separate sessions. You must register in
advance. Bring your Instruction Permit to the first class.
To inquire about a course location and to register, call
a Highway Safety/Access PEI office near you.
THE ROAD TEST
You must provide the vehicle for your road test, and
you must be accompanied by a licensed driver. Motor
vehicles used for the driving test will be checked
before your test for:
• valid licence plates;
• lights;
• horn;
• a rear-view mirror;
• seat belts;
• windshield wipers;
• muffler;
• brakes;
• tires;

Chapter 1: What the Tests Are All About
• windshield;
• window glass;
• valid inspection sticker; and
• speedometer.
A driving test will not be given in any vehicle which
is unsafe or does not meet equipment requirements.
All vehicles for road tests must be covered by public
liability insurance. Proof of insurance, in the form of
a pink insurance card, must be produced before the
road test. A valid copy of the vehicle registration is also
required.
THE PURPOSES OF THE ROAD TEST ARE:
• to measure your ability to operate the vehicle
properly and safely under typical driving conditions;
• to determine whether or not retraining is necessary;
• to serve as a basis for additional training; and
• to assist you in correcting errors uncovered during
the test.

11

Your examiner will tell you
about the procedure of the
road test. Simply follow the
instructions of the
examiner who will ride with
you. During the driving test,
do not talk unnecessarily
with the examiner, as this may distract your attention
from your driving. The examiner will not coach you
during the driving test. If there are questions you
would like to ask, do so before the start of the test. No
other person will be permitted to ride in the vehicle
during the test.
The road test is a sample of your ability to perform
certain maneuvres properly and safely, you will be
checked on:
• starting;
• stopping;

12
• turning;
• parking;
• traffic signs and signals;
• travelling through controlled, partly controlled and
uncontrolled intersections;
• anticipation of potentially hazardous conditions,
• attitude toward others; and
• other safe driving practices given throughout this
handbook.
The examiner will analyse your driving and make
suggestions about ways to improve your driving skills.
Please cooperate with the examiner as he or she is
trying to assist you in obtaining a Driver’s Licence.
NOTE: Drivers must comply with all conditions on
their Driver’s Licence. Failure to do so is an offence
under the Highway Traffic Act.

Chapter 1: Classified Licences
vehicles requires frequent updating of the
qualifications of drivers. Under the Classified Licence
System, drivers are licensed for the class or classes
of vehicles for which they are qualified to operate.
Drivers must meet vision, physical fitness, knowledge
and skill standards for the particular class or classes of
vehicles they wish to operate.
Drivers who are learning to operate vehicles in Classes
5, 6 and 9 must obtain an Instruction Permit (Class 7).
Drivers applying to learn to operate vehicles in Classes
1, 2, 3 or 4 must have a valid Class 5 Driver’s Licence
for a minimum of two years as an Instruction Permit
for the class of vehicle for which they wish to take
instruction. They must be accompanied by a licensed
driver who has held a valid class of licence for at least
four years for the vehicle in which instruction is being
given.

Chapter 1: Classified Licences
NOTE: All Driver’s Licences expire at midnight on the
birthday of the licensed driver.
NOTE: Instruction Permits (Class 7) are valid for two
years from the date of issue.
ALLOWING SOMEONE TO DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE
Make sure anyone who drives your vehicle holds a
valid Driver’s Licence or Instruction Permit (in which
case, he or she is accompanied by a licensed driver
who has held a valid Driver’s Licence for at least four
years).
MOTORCYCLE OPERATORS’ LICENCES
To qualify for a Motorcycle
Operator’s Licence a motorcycle
operator must successfully
complete a knowledge test, a
vision test and a road test on a
motorcycle. The procedures for

13
obtaining a Motorcycle Operator’s Licence are very
similar to those for obtaining a Class 5 Driver’s Licence.
The holder of an Instruction Permit who takes a road
test on a motorcycle but not in a car, will be issued a
licence specifying motorcycle operation only. During
the 356 days after receiving an Instruction Permit to
practise driving a motorcycle, a small, yellow learner’s
decal will be reqired to be placed on the back of the
motorcycle operator’s helmet.
Drivers who hold a valid Class 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 licence may
apply for a Motorcycle Instruction Permit. This permit
has the following conditions:
• daytime use only within 30 km of residence;
• NO passengers; and
• valid for 30 days from the date of endorsement.
CHANGE OF NAME OR ADDRESS
If you change your name by marriage or other legal
process, you must have your licence endorsed with a

14
change of name or address within 10 days from the
effective date of the change. There is no charge for
this service.
Change of an address must be reported to the
registrar of motor vehicles within 30 days from the
effective day of the change. Failure to notify the
registrar of a change of name or address is an offence
under the Highway Traffic Act.
Change of name or address may be reported to any of
the Highway Safety/Access PEI offices.
LOST, DESTROYED OR ILLEGIBLE LICENCES
If you lose or misplace your Driver’s Licence or if it
becomes illegible, you must apply for a duplicate
licence. There is a fee for this service. Bring the number
of the licence to be replaced and the date that licence
was issued. If you don’t have this information, bring
your birth certificate with you.

Chapter 1: Classified Licences
Duplicate licences may be applied for at any Highway
Safety/Access PEI office.
OUT-OF-PROVINCE DRIVERS’ LICENCES

Driver’s Licence from another province, state, territory
or country, you may drive in PEI for up to 120 days if
you have not been prohibited from driving under the
laws of any province, state, territory or country. You are
subject to any limitations or restrictions on the licence.
You may only drive a vehicle of the class for which you
are authorized to drive under the licence held.
Seasonal workers (as defined in Highway Safety Act
Section 80(3) ) to drive vehicles in PEI require a Class 5
driver’s license and may drive for a period of 8 months
if they have in their possession a valid Foreign Driver’s
License that does allow for the operation of vehicles

• any trailer drawn by the motor vehicle is registered;
• the vehicle and trailer have a licence according
to its class; and
• the motor vehicle and trailer have the proper 		
number plates, valid inspection stickers or markers
which have been issued under the Highway Traffic

IN-TRANSIT PERMITS
Permits for single journeys of unregistered unladen
vehicles may be issued by the registrar of motor
vehicles, for a fee, for such purposes as movement to a
registration office for registration of the vehicle or
movement of the vehicle from one place to another
for repairs or for inspection prior to registration, etc.

Chapter 1: Vehicle Registration
Proof of public liability must be shown when making
application for in-transit permits.
APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION
To apply for registration, you need:

Safety/Access PEI office;
• the public liability insurance card; and
• a successful motor vehicle inspection report form.
An application for registration of a vehicle owned by a
corporate body should be signed by a signing officer,
on behalf of that body.
A Highway Safety official may require that the vehicle
be re-examined at your expense to confirm its
condition. An inspector may ask you to dismantle and
expose any part of the vehicle.

23
NUMBER PLATES
Highway Safety issues one number plate only for all
vehicles including trailers, motorcycles and mopeds.
Validation stickers may be issued to put on the
number plate. Make sure the plate is always securely
fastened to the vehicle. It must be at least 200
millimetres (12 inches) from the ground measured
from the bottom of the plate.
Motorcycle and trailer plates must be clearly visible
from the rear.
Keep your number plate clean and in good condition
so it is always clearly visible and legible. The vehicle
or its equipment or load must not obscure the view of
the plate. At night a rear light must shine on the plate.
Do not put a plate or number on your vehicle which
could be confused with your proper number plate.

• it was obtained by false pretenses; or
• it is being used contrary to the act or the
regulations.
The traffic officer may keep the number plate until the
facts about the plate have been determined.

streets and highways must be registered and must
display valid licence plates. Motorcycles and mopeds
must be covered by public liability insurance in order
to be registered.

NOTE: Minibikes are not registered for highway use on
Prince Edward Island. They cannot be used on public
roads or sidewalks. They MUST be registered for offhighway use according to the Off-Highway Vehicle Act
and display an off-highway vehicle plate.

25
OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLES
Off-highway vehicles are important equipment to
farmers, wood lot operators, trappers and others
whose jobs require travel over rough terrain; however,
the vast majority of them are used for recreation –
sometimes by people who lack experience with either
the vehicle or the environment, or both.
Off-highway vehicles may be fun, but they are not
toys. With a capacity for speeds up to 100 kilometres
per hour, these machines can be dangerous in the
hands of inexperienced operators.
In addition to the risk of injury, off-highway vehicles
can do serious environmental damage, destroy crops
or harm private property. The restrictions placed on
the use of off-highway vehicles are intended to lessen
the potential for injury or property damage, without

Chapter 1: Vehicle Registration

26
depriving responsible operators and their families
of the benefits and pleasures of using off-highway
vehicles.
The following is a list of all vehicles included in the PEI
Off-Highway Vehicle Act:
• four-wheel drive or low pressure tire vehicles,
• power motorcycles and related two-wheel vehicles,
• amphibious machines,
• all terrain vehicles, and
• snow vehicles.
NOTE:
Effective February 10, 2007, the following regulations
came into effect:
• No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle
without protective clothing and equipment.
• No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle
that has an engine size in excess of that

•
•

•

•
		
		

recommended by the manufacturer for the age
and weight of the operator.
No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle in
the ditch next to a highway.
The owner of the off-highway vehicle is prohibited
from permitting a person to operate it, unless the
person holds a valid driver’s licence and the person
has held a driver’s licence for 24 months; or has
successfully completed an off-highway vehicle 		
safety training course approved by the registrar.
No person shall operate an off-highway vehicle by
crossing a highway unless that person holds a
valid driver’s licence and that person has held a
driver’s licence for 24 months; or has successfully
completed an off-highway vehicle safety training
course approved by the registrar.
Any person who is less than 14 years of age is
prohibited from operating an off-highway vehicle,
other than a snowmobile.

certain requirements.
If you are16 years of age or older, you must have
held a driver’s licence for 24 months; or have 		
successfully completed an ATV safety training 		
course approved by the registrar.
The owner of an off-highway vehicle is prohibited
from permitting the operation of the off-highway
vehicle by a person who is prohibited from 		
operating it.

REGISTRATION OF SNOWMOBILES
Registration is required for snowmobiles annually on
or before November 30. If a transfer of ownership

27
occurs, the snowmobile must be registered in the
new owner’s name within seven days from the date
of purchase. All other off-highway vehicles have to be
registered only once by the owner and have to be reregistered only if there is a transfer of ownership.
When a snowmobile is registered, a number plate is
provided which must be firmly attached to the rear of
the machine. If the number plate should become lost
or illegible, the owner must purchase a new plate
from any office of Highway Safety/Access PEI.
OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE REGISTRATION
All off-highway vehicles must be registered. You must
produce the certificate of registration if any peace
officer asks for it.

28
A peace officer is any police officer, a Highway Safety
officer or a park warden. The peace officer will give
the vehicle operator reasonable time to produce the
certificate of registration. If you do not follow this rule,
you may be found guilty of an offence and be fined.
CHANGE OF NAME OR ADDRESS
If a motor vehicle’s certificate of registration is issued
to you and you later change your name or address,
you must notify the Highway Safety office of the
change within 30 days.
EXPIRATION OF REGISTRATION
All vehicle registrations, including the licence or
identification plate, marker and permit expire on the
registered owner’s birthday or company’s registration
date.

Chapter 1: Vehicle Registration
NON-RESIDENT PRIVILEGES
If you are a non-resident of Prince Edward Island,
you may operate your passenger vehicle which is
registered in your province, state, territory or country
for your own private use in Prince Edward Island for up
to four months in any year without registering the
vehicle here.
If you are a non-resident who enters Prince Edward
Island with the vehicle to solicit business, you may
operate the vehicle in this province for up to 10 days
in any year without registering the vehicle.
No commercial motor vehicle owned or operated by
or on behalf of a non-resident may be operated in
Prince Edward Island unless it is registered here.
Every vehicle owned or operated by a non-resident in
this province is subject to all the restrictions and

Chapter 1: Vehicle Registration
control which apply to a vehicle registered in the
province.
For all other non-Canadian residents, they are
permitted to drive in PEI with an immigration visa,
a valid passport and a valid foreign driver’s licence.
Foreign driver’s licences must be turned in before a PEI
driver’s licence is issued. Foreign driver’s licences are
valid to drive with for 120 days upon entry into PEI.
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP
Whenever the owner of a registered vehicle transfers
or sells the vehicle the owner must, within seven days
of the transfer, notify Highway Safety of the transfer
on a Notification of Transfer form (contained on the
vehicle registration permit or available from any
Highway Safety/Access PEI office). The new owner
must within seven days of the transfer have the
registration permit transferred into his/her name.

29
The vehicle registration permit, the motor vehicle
inspection report form and proof of liability insurance
must be presented to the Highway Safety/Access PEI
Office, and the required fee paid.
Most registered motor vehicles and trailers must have
a yearly safety inspection at an official inspection
station. These stations are situated all across the
province. An authorized inspection mechanic will
conduct a prescribed safety inspection in accordance
with Motor Vehicle Inspection Regulations. A motor
vehicle inspection approval sticker will be placed in
a prescribed area. It must be kept in good condition.
You will also receive a motor vehicle inspection report
that must be kept in good condition in the vehicle and
must be shown to a peace officer on request. Approval
stickers issued for the month in which a vehicle was
inspected will normally be valid until the end of that
month in the following year.

30

Chapter 1: Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection

You cannot register a vehicle that you have bought
unless it has a valid approval sticker. The registrar
or any peace officer may order a vehicle to be reinspected at any time.
When a registered owner takes up residence in Prince
Edward Island, a private passenger vehicle inspected
in either Nova Scotia or New Brunswick may be
registered without local inspection. Its provincial
inspection will be considered valid for one year from
the date of inspection. Prior to that expiry date, it
must have an inspection in Prince Edward Island.
Vehicles from all other places must be inspected in
Prince Edward Island before being registered here.

REJECTED VEHICLES
The owner or operator of a rejected vehicle has 10
days from the date of rejection to have the defects
corrected and the vehicle re-inspected. This does not
permit the operation of an unsafe vehicle during this
time.
Note:
While a rejected sticker is
valid for 10 days after it has
been punched, it will not be
accepted on a vehicle to be
used for a driving test.

The Highway Traffic Act
requires all equipment on your vehicle which must be
maintained in good working order.

Chapter 1: Required Vehicle Equipment
HEAD LAMPS AND REAR LAMPS
Every vehicle on the highway must be equipped with
front and rear lamps as required for each class of
vehicle. These lamps must be lighted during the
period from sunset to sunrise, and at any other time
when visibility is limited by fog, rain, snow or other
atmospheric conditions, or when there is not sufficient
light to see a person or a vehicle on the highway 150
metres (500 feet) ahead. At times when lights are
required, it is illegal to use parking lights alone.
All vehicles 1990 and newer must be equipped with

able to control and operate the windshield wipers. The
wipers must be kept in good working order.

35

ORNAMENTS
Ornaments and decorations, either inside or outside of
the vehicle, must be located so that they do not
obstruct the vision or distract the attention of the
driver.
FLAG OR LIGHT AT END OF LOAD
Whenever the load of any motor vehicle extends more
than 1.2 metres (four feet) beyond the rear of the
body, a red flag not less than 0.3 metres (12 inches) in
length and width must be displayed during daylight
hours. A red light which is plainly visible for 150 metres
(500 feet) must be displayed during hours of darkness.
SLOW-MOVING VEHICLE SIGN
Any motor vehicle not capable of maintaining a rate of
speed in excess of 40 km/hr (25 mph) under normal
conditions and every farm tractor must display a slowmoving vehicle sign at the rear.

Chapter 1: Required Vehicle Equipment

MUFFLER
No person may drive a motor vehicle on a highway
unless the vehicle is equipped with a muffler in good
working order so as to prevent excessive or unusual
noise. The use of a muffler cut-out bypass, straight
exhaust, gutted muffler, Hollywood muffler or similar
device is prohibited. In addition, the engine of any
vehicle may not emit excessive smoke or fumes.
SPEEDOMETER, BUMPERS, SAFETY GLASS, TIRES
Motor vehicles must be equipped with:
• a speedometer in good working order;
• front and rear bumpers (if the motor vehicle has
been so designed by the manufacturer); and
• tires must be replaced if their tread depth is less
than 1.6 mm (2/32 of an inch) when measured in
any three locations 120 degrees apart.

FLARES OR LANTERNS
A passenger vehicle with a seating capacity of eight
passengers or more and a vehicle having a capacity
of more than one-half ton of freight must be equipped
with at least two flares, reflectors or red lanterns,
and two red flags for warning other drivers of an
emergency breakdown.
A commercial vehicle of 2.05 metres (80 inches) or
more in width, a passenger bus with a seating capacity
of eight or more, and a motor vehicle towing a travel
trailer must be equipped with at least three flares or
three red electric lanterns, each of which is capable
of being seen at a distance of 150 metres (500 feet)
under normal nighttime conditions.
A truck tractor or vehicle carrying flammable liquids in
bulk or compressed flammable gases must be
equipped with at least three red electric lanterns.

Chapter 1: Required Vehicle Equipment
When any vehicle becomes disabled on the travelled
portion of any highway or shoulder at any time when
lighted lamps are required on vehicles, its driver
must display three lighted lanterns or flares, one at
a distance of 30 metres (100 feet) to the rear of the
vehicle, one at a distance of 30 metres (100 feet) to the
front of the vehicle and one on the traffic side of the
vehicle approximately three metres (10 feet) rearward
or forward. During daytime hours these vehicles are
required to display two red flags on the roadway in
the lane of traffic it occupies at distances of 30 metres
(100 feet) to the front and the rear of the vehicle. Flares
should be displayed in poor weather conditions or
when the vehicle has to be stopped where oncoming
drivers cannot easily see it.
FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
Every commercial vehicle transporting any explosives
as cargo must be equipped with not less than two fire

37

extinguishers, filled and ready for use. Every school bus
must be equipped with at least one fire extinguisher,
filled and ready for use.
WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH OF VEHICLE
No vehicle may exceed a total outside width, including
loads, of 2.6 metres (102 inches), or a height of
4.15 metres (14 feet, six inches) without a special
permit. A single motor vehicle may not exceed a
length of 12.5 metres (40 feet), and a combination
of vehicles coupled together may not exceed a total
length of 25 metres (81 feet) without a special permit.
TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS GOODS
Only qualified people may transport dangerous goods.
It is illegal to transport these materials in your vehicle.
Always make sure that you know the law and follow
all safety precautions when hauling these types of
materials.

SAVE ENERGY, SAVE MONEY
You can control the costs of operating a vehicle and
minimize the emissions it produces by making a
commitment to drive less and to drive more efficiently.
The following tips can improve your fuel efficiency by
helping you drive the Auto$mart way.

Under-inflated tires wear faster, waste fuel and are
unsafe.

Maintain your vehicle. Give your car a full tune-up,
including an oil and oil filter change. Oil breaks down
under use and won’t lubricate, cool or protect as well.
A poorly tuned engine increases fuel consumption.
And a well-tuned engine minimizes engine wear.

Using an air conditioner in stop-and-go traffic can
increase fuel consumption by as much as 20 per
cent. To stay cool at highway speeds, use your car’s
flow-through ventilation. Open windows can be a
fuel-saving alternative to air conditioning at low city
speeds; however, at highway speeds open windows
increase drag and heighten fuel consumption.

Measure the inflation pressure of your tires at least
once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., when your
vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours or
when it has been driven for less than two kilometres).
Warm tires give an inaccurate reading because heat
buildup increases tire pressure during use.

Idling consumes fuel. Ten seconds of idling can use
up more fuel than restarting the engine. Turn off the
ignition if you are waiting for someone.

A full roof rack can increase fuel consumption. Even
the most streamlined roof rack will increase fuel
consumption. If the carrier is not permanently affixed
to your automobile, remove it when it’s not needed.

40

Chapter 1: Help Protect the Environment

Cruise control allows you to set the car’s cruising
speed and take your foot off the gas pedal. By
maintaining a constant speed on long trips, your
cruise control feature will reduce fuel consumption,
provided the terrain is relatively flat.
Drive the posted speed limit. Increasing your
speed from 100 km/h to 120 km/h will increase fuel
consumption by about 20%.
Avoid “flooring” your gas pedal from a dead
stop. You’ll consume about 37% more fuel during a
“jackrabbit” start than if you pull away gradually.
Visit vehicles.gc.ca to get more information on how
to buy, drive and maintain your vehicle to save energy
and money, as well as protect the environment.

Chapter 1: Help Protect the Environment
WINTER TIPS FOR DRIVERS – DRIVING HABITS
Winter weather can increase your vehicle’s fuel
consumption by as much as 50%. Canadian drivers
that adopt these simple-to-do winter driving tips
highlighted below can save money, fuel, help protect
the environment, and improve road safety by
winterizing their vehicles.
To learn more visit: www.vehicles.gc.ca
Remote car starters result in unnecessary idling
and wasted fuel. Remote car starters may seem like
a convenient accessory however there are many
hidden costs associated with their regular use. People
with remote car starters tend to start their cars long
before they are ready to drive, which needlessly burns
fuel. Since car starters are significantly less effective
than block heaters in warming up your engine, cars
equipped with car starters will be more likely to

41

develop buildups of harmful sludge and deposits
in their engines and engine components from
improperly combusted fuel. Regular use of remote car
starters is also not an environmentally friendly practice
as they needlessly contribute to harmful greenhouse
gas emissions, which feed climate change.
Save fuel and save money by using a timed block
heater. Use an automatic timer to switch on the block
heater two hours before you plan to drive your vehicle.
A block heater enables the vehicle’s engine to start
more easily and reach its peak operating temperature
faster. In below-zero temperatures, block heaters can
improve overall fuel economy by as much as 10% or
more.
Prevent fogging. The sooner you can clear your
windows the sooner you can get on the road. Waiting
for your windows to defog is frustrating when you are

42

Chapter 1: Help Protect the Environment

in a hurry to go. There are two simple tricks to prevent
your car windows from fogging up. One is to open a
window as soon as you enter the vehicle. The second
is to clear all the snow from the air intake on top of the
hood. Otherwise, the defroster will draw moisture into
the system and fog the windshield, which will delay
you from getting on the road.
Clear away snow and ice. Fuel consumption increases
as snow and ice build up on and around the vehicle
you’re driving. Everyone knows that driving with
extra weight in your vehicle makes your engine work
harder and increases fuel consumption. As snow and
ice build in wheel wells and under bumpers, it adds
weight and rubs against tires, further increasing rolling
resistance. Snow piled on top of the vehicle increases
aerodynamic drag as well as vehicle weight. For safety
as well as fuel economy, clear all the snow and ice off
your vehicle before you drive away.

Combine your stops. The fewer stops you make
the better. Did you know that a vehicle operating
with a cold engine consumes 50% more fuel, until it
warms up many minutes later, compared to a vehicle
operating with a warm engine? By combining your
errands you not only save fuel by reducing your
travel but also ensure that your engine reaches its
optimal operating temperature – and stays that
way. Combining your trips minimizes your fuel
consumption and emissions.
Plan your trip. Trip planning is particularly important
in the winter. The less time you spend driving the less
fuel your vehicle will consume. Carefully planning
your trip before you head out on the road will help
ensure that you spend less time on the road and more
time doing things you enjoy. Plan your route to avoid
obstacles such as unplowed roads, hills and multiple
traffic lights. In many cases it is more fuel-efficient

Chapter 1: Help Protect the Environment
to take a slightly longer route if it is relatively free
of many traffic obstacles, which can slow you down.
When parking, try to park your vehicle downhill; and
if possible, try to park your vehicle in sheltered areas,
i.e., on the side of a building sheltered by the wind.
These simple tricks will help to ensure that it will be
easier to pull away from the parking spot.
Drive efficiently. Excessive acceleration and braking
dramatically increases fuel consumption. Drivers can
save fuel by driving at a smooth, even speed and by
anticipating lane changes and traffic obstructions.
Winter conditions make slowing down and stopping
more difficult. Drivers should be aware that winter
road conditions, such as wet, icy or snow covered
roads, increase braking distance. By increasing your
following distance between you and the vehicle in
front you will allow yourself more response time

43

which will help to save fuel and to make winter driving
easier on yourself and other drivers on the roadways.
Take it easy. Give yourself more time to get from A
to B in the winter. More thought and care are required
for driving in the winter season. The faster and more
aggressively you drive in the winter the more your
vehicle slips and slides and spins its wheels. Not only
will these actions use more fuel, but also you will be at
a higher risk of being involved in a serious collision.
Ski racks. Ski racks are a drag when not in use.
Avid skiers know well enough that drag affects
aerodynamics. Therefore, you should remove your
ski racks when not heading to the slopes. The
drag caused by mounted ski racks increases fuel
consumption, so consider using removable ski racks
that you can easily remove from your vehicle when
not needed.

Automobile collisions can be traumatic events.
Responsible drivers greatly reduce the risk of a
collision by obeying traffic regulations. These drivers
realize it is their responsibility to drive carefully so as
not to cause any harm to themselves or other persons
or damage to property.
Collisions do happen even to the most careful drivers.
The force of a collision is so great that unrestrained
persons may strike each other, the interior of the
vehicle or may be ejected from the vehicle. Severe
injuries or death often result. Using a seat belt or
child restraint system correctly helps hold all persons
in place in the vehicle. This provides them with a far
better chance of avoiding serious injury.
Seat belts and child restraints also help prevent
injuries during “regular” driving. A driver may have to
swerve and stop, or stop suddenly to avoid a collision.

Chapter 2: Driver Responsibility
Fewer than one percent of all injury-producing
collisions involve fire or submersion. In these
situations, wearing a seat belt greatly increases the
chances of remaining conscious in order to escape
from the vehicle.
Everyone 16 years of age and older, whether a driver
or passenger riding in a motor vehicle in Prince
Edward Island, is required by law to wear a seat belt if
a seating position with a seat belt is available to them.
A driver is responsible for ensuring that all passengers
under 16 years of age are wearing a seat belt in a
seating position with a seat belt available to them.
Young children must be placed in an approved child
restraint system that is appropriate for them.

Chapter 2: Driver Responsibility
INFANTS
The law requires that infants
from birth weight to 10 kg
(22 lb) and a minimum of
one year of age travel rearfacing in a child restraint
seat that conforms to the
requirements of Standard 213.1
under the Canadian Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards (CMVSS) – Transport
Canada, and the PEI Seat Belt Regulations.
This may be a portable infant carrier or a convertible
seat that will serve infants and toddlers. Current
regulations state infants from birth weight to 10 kg
(22 lb) must travel rear-facing.
Every child restraint system sold in Canada must meet
Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.

47
The standards are set by Transport Canada, but it is the
manufacturers who must certify that their products
meet the applicable standard(s). Transport Canada
does random testing of child restraints to ensure
compliance.
CMVSS documentation is available at www.tc.gc.ca/

TODDLERS
Toddlers from 10 to 18 kg (22
to 40 lb) must travel in a child
restraint seat conforming to the
requirements of the Highway
Traffic Act or the CMVSS.This
can be the convertible type
of seat used by infants too,
or a child seat made just for
toddlers. When a toddler
travels in a vehicle, other than
a parent’s or legal guardian’s, a
lap belt may be used.
NOTE: Restraint seats must have a properly installed
anchor as your forward facing seat must use a
tether strap. You can contact your automobile dealer
concerning installation.

Chapter 2: Driver Responsibility
PRESCHOOLERS
Booster seats are required for children who are too big
for a child car seat but too small to be protected by
a seat belt. This includes preschool to primary-grade
children weighing between 18 and 36 kg (40 to 80 lb),
with a standing height of less than 145 cm (four feet 9
inches) or under the age of ten years.
All booster seats must be used with the lap shoulder
belt for children who have outgrown their forwardfacing child restraint seat. Make sure it is used in the
back seat and the lap belt is worn snugly over the
child’s hips (not over the stomach). Children under the
age of 12 should ride in the back seat of the car. It’s
the safest place.

Chapter 2: Driver Responsibility
PROPER FIT OF SEAT BELTS
Lap belts should be worn snugly and as low around
the hips as possible. Shoulder belts must never
be worn without a lap belt. Shoulder belts should
not be too tight. Leave a fist’s width between your
chest and the belt. The use of a shoulder belt is not
recommended for a child or an adult less than 140 cm
(47 in) in height.
AIR BAGS
Air bags are safety devices that
protect the head and upper body
from injury in a collision. They
prevent the driver’s head from
hitting the steering wheel and
the front passenger’s head from
striking the dashboard.

49
While air bags save many lives each year, they do not
protect in all kinds of crashes. They deploy in frontal
impacts only, and not in rear-end collisions, side
impacts or rollovers. They may also deploy in lowspeed collisions sometimes as low as 15 kilometres
per hour. Seat belts, on the other hand, protect the
entire body and are effective in all types of collisions.
In low and moderate-speed impacts, seat belts alone
provide all the protection necessary. Air bags are most
effective in high-speed crashes, where they are often
necessary to prevent serious injury. Together, seat belts
and air bags offer good protection in most collisions.
CAUTION: People who sit close to the air bag module,
usually because they are short, are at risk of injury
when the air bag is deployed. Children are also
vulnerable because they are small. They should be
properly belted, and those under the age of 12 should
be seated in the back seat.

50
WARNING: It is very important to prevent children
from sitting or standing close to the dashboard. Never
install a rearward-facing infant restraint system in a
seat equipped with an air bag. If the air bag deploys,
the infant restraint system will be propelled into the
back of the seat.
SOME SEAT BELT AND AIR BAG FACTS
• You are many times more likely to be killed or
seriously injured if thrown from the vehicle in a 		
collision.
• Fire or submersion in water is rare in collisions.
Safety belts keep you conscious and uninjured,
enabling you to get free of the car.
• Safety belts can help prevent serious collisions
by keeping the driver behind the wheel and in
control of the vehicle.
• Many injuries and deaths result from collisions at
60 km/h (40 mph) or less.

Chapter 2: Driver Responsibility
• Most collisions occur close to home.
• Unbelted vehicle occupants can seriously injure
fellow passengers by striking or crushing them
against the car in a collision.
• Children should never be held on an adult lap
because the force of a collision may tear the child
from the adult’s arms. In addition, the child may be
crushed between the adult and the car if the adult is
not buckled in.
• Injuries from safety belts are very rare, usually
occurring only in very severe collisions and
resulting from improper use or adjustment of
the belts.
• Never have more than one person in a seat belt.

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road

The Rules of the Road are laws and safe practices that
have developed out of custom and experience. They
are for the safe and efficient movement of vehicles,
pedestrians and other road users. They cover such
things as starting, signaling, turning, overtaking and
passing, stopping and other actions of drivers and
other road users. You will be required to demonstrate
your knowledge of these rules and your ability to
apply them properly before you can get a licence.

such a speed, or is so close, that a collision will occur
if each continues on its respective way. Since most of
these intersections are in residential areas, your view
of approaching cars, cyclists, pedestrians and children
will often be obscured. Under such conditions you
should slow down to a speed that will permit you to
have complete control of your vehicle. Remember that
you do not automatically have the right-of-way by
entering the intersection first.

RIGHT-OF-WAY AT THREE-WAY OR FOUR-WAY
INTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED BY STOP SIGNS
When two or more vehicles enter such an intersection
from different directions at approximately the same
time, the vehicle on the left will yield the right-of-way
to the vehicle on the right. It is a good practice to slow
down to a speed that will permit you to stop if you see
a vehicle coming from your right that is travelling at

The law says that before entering a highway you must
come to a complete
stop and not proceed
unless you can do so
safely. The stop must
be made before any
marked or unmarked
crosswalk, or where
none exists, then

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
before the travelled portion of the highway you are
about to enter.
RIGHT-OF-WAY OF A CAR TURNING LEFT
There are many duties and responsibilities of a driver
making a left turn. When you turn left you must:
• be in the proper lane;
• give a visible signal of your intention to
turn; and
• yield the right-of-way to any vehicle 			
or pedestrian
within, or so close
to the intersection
that a collision 		
could result.

53
RIGHT-OF-WAY AT LANES, DRIVEWAYS
AND ALLEYS
If you are driving in a rural area and you wish to enter
or cross a highway from a private road, lane, driveway,
or building you must:
• stop and yield the right-of-way to traffic on
the street or highway;
• not enter the highway if there is any danger
of collision; and
• not enter the highway if the other driver would be
forced to swerve or brake to avoid a collision.

54
If you are driving in a restricted speed area, such as a
50 km/h (30 mph) zone in any city or town, you must:
• stop your car before driving onto the crosswalk;
• check for pedestrians and other vehicles that may
be approaching and yield the right-of-way to
them; and
• do not proceed until you are sure it is safe to do so.
Always remember that the responsibility to avoid a
collision rests with you.
RIGHT-OF-WAY AT STOP SIGNS
Stop signs are placed at those intersections where
extra hazards exist, such as heavy traffic or limited
visibility. When you approach a stop sign always
follow these rules:
• start slowing down soon enough so that you can
stop smoothly;
• in a city or town, stop your vehicle:
a) before entering a crosswalk; or

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
b) at a clearly marked stop line; or
c) at a point nearest the intersecting roadways
		 where pedestrians would normally cross.
• in rural areas:
a) stop your
		 vehicle before
		 the edge of
		 the roadway
		 you are about
		 to enter;
b) look carefully
		 in both
		 directions 		
		 before starting to observe the speed and 		
		 distance of approaching traffic;
c) if the road is slippery you will need a larger gap
		 in traffic before you can start up;
d) look twice in both directions starting with the
		 left (or closest lanes of traffic); and

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
e) yield the right-of-way to any traffic that is close,
		 or is travelling at such a speed, that there would
		 be danger of a collision if you proceeded.
Rolling a stop sign is illegal. Remember that stop signs
are placed at those intersections where extra hazards
exist, such as heavy traffic or limited visibility. Slowing
rather than stopping for stop signs is a dangerous
practice and one that will eventually lead to collisions.
If you are a beginner, develop the habit of always
making a full stop. If you have driven for some years,
you may have developed the habit of “rolling” through
stop signs; this habit must be corrected.

55
• immediately
moving clear of
an intersection;
• driving as closely
as possible to
the right-hand
curb or edge of
the roadway; and
• stopping and
remaining
stopped until the emergency vehicle or
vehicles have passed.
NOTE: On one-way streets, pull to the right or left.

RIGHT-OF-WAY OF EMERGENCY VEHICLES
Whenever an emergency vehicle, ambulance, fire
department vehicle or police car, sounding a siren,
horn or warning signals, approaches from any
direction, you must yield the right-of-way by:

RIGHT-OF-WAY OF FUNERAL PROCESSION
Drivers of vehicles in a funeral procession with lighted
headlights are required to exercise care when
coming to a red traffic light or stop sign. Only if a

56
police officer is present and directs, then may you
proceed through the red light or stop sign with
caution. All approaching vehicles must reduce their
speed to half the posted speed limit. At no time will a
driver of a vehicle attempt to pass through a funeral
procession from behind. Funeral vehicles on PEI are
equipped with purple flashing lights.
RIGHT-OF-WAY AT YIELD SIGNS
Yield signs provide a realistic and flexible means
of controlling traffic at certain locations. When
approaching a yield sign, you must slow down to a
speed that will make it possible for you
to stop and yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians and vehicles. If necessary,
stop and yield the right-of-way to
anyone on the roadway, then proceed
with caution.

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
PEDESTRIANS’ RIGHTS AND DUTIES AT
INTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED BY TRAFFIC
SIGNALS
Both drivers and pedestrians must
obey the traffic signal that controls
an intersection. Whenever a
pedestrian enters the crosswalk
with a “walk” or green signal light,
the pedestrian has the right-of-way
over all vehicles. A pedestrian must not leave the curb
and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so
close that a driver cannot safely yield the right-of-way.
When the amber light or “wait” sign appears a
pedestrian must not start to cross. If a pedestrian is
in the intersection when the amber light or “wait”
sign appears, he or she must proceed to the nearest
sidewalk. A driver must yield the right-of-way to a
pedestrian and must not proceed until the pedestrian
is safely across the street.

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
PEDESTRIANS’ RIGHTS AND DUTIES AT FLASHING
RED LIGHTS
When approaching an intersection controlled by a
flashing red light, a driver must come
to a full stop and remain stopped
until it is safe to proceed. Pedestrians
may enter the roadway with caution,
and have the right-of-way over
vehicles.
FLASHING AMBER
When approaching an intersection
controlled by a flashing amber light,
a driver must enter with caution
and yield the right-of-way to any
pedestrians within the crosswalks.
Pedestrians should remember that
drivers are not required to come to a full stop for a

57
flashing amber light; and before entering the roadway
against an amber light, a pedestrian should exercise
extra care and be on guard against drivers who may
not be prepared to stop.
PEDESTRIANS’ RIGHTS AND DUTIES AT
INTERSECTIONS WITH NO TRAFFIC SIGNALS
Pedestrians have the right-of-way within a marked
or unmarked crosswalk at an intersection with a
stop sign or yield sign, and at an open intersection.
Drivers must yield
to a pedestrian.
Pedestrians should
always exercise
caution when entering an intersection
where drivers are not
required to stop.

58
VEHICLES STOPPED FOR PEDESTRIANS
One of the frequent causes of pedestrian collisions is
one vehicle passing another that is stopped for
pedestrians. The law requires that when a vehicle has
stopped for a pedestrian, a driver approaching from
behind must not pass the stopped vehicle. The driver
of the first vehicle approaching the crosswalk should
attempt to stop a sufficient distance away to give
other drivers a clear view of the crosswalk and the
driver of the oncoming vehicle must also stop. Always
use extreme caution
before you attempt
to pass a vehicle
which is stopped
or slowing down
at an intersection.
Remember that he or
she has a clearer view
of the road ahead.

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
If you are about to pass a larger vehicle, always be
aware of the pedestrian who may walk or run into
your path. This is
particularly true if you
are driving in the lane
next to the stopped
vehicle. Slow down
as you are about to
pass. Never pass a
vehicle stopped for a
pedestrian.
ADVICE TO PEDESTRIANS
• Always cross at intersections and keep within the
crosswalk. Crossing between intersections is
a hazardous practice. If you must cross between
intersections, first yield the right-of-way to all
vehicles.

Chapter 2: Rules of the Road
• Never walk into the roadway from behind parked
vehicles or from the rear of a stopped bus. If the
driver cannot see you, he or she cannot avoid you.
• Always look for turning vehicles before trying to
cross.
• Teach your children never to play on or near the
roadway, and always to use the crosswalks.
• At night wear white, light coloured or retro
reflective material clothing. The driver will be able
to see you at a greater distance.
• On the highways, always walk on the left, facing
traffic, so that you can see approaching vehicles;
whenever possible stay off the pavement.
• New crosswalks have sounds in addition to the
light signalling pedestrians that it is safe to cross
the road. This is for the visually impaired
pedestrians.

59
ADVICE TO DRIVERS
• The law requires that you exercise care for the safety
of pedestrians WHEREVER they may be crossing.
• In residential areas, slow down and be on alert for
youngsters who may suddenly run into your path.
• If you see any children, or a confused or incapacitated person, slow down and be prepared to stop.
• Always stop for pedestrians within crosswalks
and never pass a vehicle that has stopped for a
pedestrian.
• A blind or partially blind person carries a white cane
to indicate that he or she cannot see. Whenever you
see a pedestrian carrying a white cane, drive with
caution and be prepared to stop. Often a blind
person will raise his/her cane when they are
uncertain of crossing the street in safety. That is
your signal to STOP and allow him/her to go ahead.
The same courtesy should be extended to persons
led by a seeing-eye dog. Remember that their lives
may depend on you.

Chapter 3:

Signs, Pavement Markings and Work Zones

62
Traffic lights are placed at busy intersections to make
them safer. Both drivers and pedestrians must obey
traffic lights, except in cases when a police/traffic
officer directs otherwise.
GREEN LIGHTS
One of the most important misconceptions is that the
green light gives the driver an absolute right-of-way.
The green signal is only a qualified permission to
proceed carefully in the direction permitted by the
signal. It does not give you the right to rush into an
intersection without regard for the safety of others.
When the green light is in
your favour, observe the
following:
• Yield the right-of-way to
any other vehicles lawfully
within an intersection, and
to pedestrians within the
crosswalk.

• Proceed only in the direction of the “green arrow”
when a “green arrow” signal is accompanied by a
red light.
• When turning right or left you must yield the rightof-way to any pedestrians who are within your half
of the roadway, or so close that there may be
danger of a collision.
• Do not enter an intersection unless you are certain
of clearing it before the next change of signal lights.
AMBER LIGHTS
The purpose of the amber light is to allow persons
within the intersection to clear the intersection before
the light changes.
Whenever you are approaching
an intersection controlled by
traffic signal lights, be alert
to the fact that the lights
may change against you.

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals
Have your car under control, and never speed up
as you approach an intersection. Try to be aware of
traffic lights at least a block ahead of you in order
to anticipate that a green light may change before
you get there. It is a violation of the Highway Traffic
Act to enter an intersection on an amber light, unless
stopping cannot be done safely.
RED LIGHT
A red light means you must bring your vehicle to a
stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if none, at the
nearest crosswalk or, if none, before entering the
intersection.
Wait until the signal changes
to green before proceeding
through the intersection
unless signs or signals permit
special movements of traffic
to proceed.

63
RIGHT TURNS AT RED LIGHT
A right turn is permitted at a red light after making a
complete stop, providing there is no sign prohibiting a
turn, and subject to the right-of-way of pedestrians or
other traffic in or approaching the intersection.
Do not impede or hold up traffic behind you after you
have stopped and the way is clear safely proceed.
FLASHING RED LIGHT
A flashing red light means you must bring your vehicle
to a complete stop and proceed only when it is safe to
do so.
The flashing red light may be an
overhead light, a standard traffic
signal light or a beacon located
directly above a stop sign.

64
FLASHING AMBER LIGHT
A flashing amber light means
caution. When facing a flashing
amber light, slow down and be
prepared to stop.
SCHOOL SIGNAL LIGHTS
At many points where traffic is heavy, signal lights
have been placed at intersections and between
intersections to make crossing of these streets safer
for children. These signals are in operation when
children are going to or from school. There may be
advance warning signs before the signal light.
RAILROAD CROSSING LIGHTS
Although there are no railways in Prince Edward Island,
extra caution should be taken by drivers when
driving outside of Prince Edward Island. Signal lights or
warning lights flash when a train is approaching. When
approaching a railway crossing where a signal device

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals
is warning of the approach of a train, you must stop
not less than five metres (15 feet) from the nearest rail.
The same rule applies when a flagperson signals that a
train is coming.
The deadliest of all highway collisions occur between
a motor vehicle and a train. Public highway/railway
crossings are marked with signs, and may also have
mechanical or electrical warning devices. Learn what
they are and watch for them.
• ADVANCE WARNING SIGNS
These signs tell you to look, listen and slow down
because you may have to stop. There may be an
advisory speed tab erected below the advance
warning sign to show that the safe road speed is less
than the posted speed. The advance warning sign also
advises the driver of the angle it crosses the road.

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals
• PAVEMENT MARKINGS
Pavement markings consist of an “X” and/or STOP line
that may be painted on the pavement at the approach
to highway/railway crossings.
• RAILWAY CROSSING SIGNS
Railway crossing signs are found at all public highway/
railway crossings. A railway crossing sign means
drivers must yield to all trains. If there is more than
one track, the sign below the railway crossing sign
indicates the number of tracks.
• RAILWAY CROSSING SIGNS WITH A STOP SIGN
If a stop sign is erected at a highway/railway crossing,
the driver must stop no closer than five metres (15
feet) and no further than 15 metres (45 metres) from
the nearest rail. Drivers must not proceed until they
can do so safely.

65
• RAILWAY CROSSING SIGNS WITH FLASHING
LIGHTS AND BELL
If flashing lights and bell are erected at a highway/
railway crossing, the driver must stop when the lights
and bell are activated because this means that a train
is approaching. All drivers must stop at the stop line
painted on the roadway or if none exists, no closer
than five metres (15 feet) from the nearest rail. Do not
proceed until the lights and bell have stopped, the
train has passed or until you can do so safely. If there is
more than one track, make sure all the tracks are clear
before crossing.
CROSSWALKS
Crosswalks are provided at intersections and other
locations where they may be required by the volume
of vehicles and pedestrians.

66
CROSSWALKS AT INTERSECTIONS
Crosswalks connect sidewalks on each side of the
roadway indicating the path that pedestrians are
to follow when crossing the street. At intersections
without traffic signals drivers are required to stop
when a pedestrian enters the crosswalk on or close to
the side of the roadway that the driver is using.
SCHOOL CROSSWALKS
School crosswalks are provided where the school
or community posts a crossing guard to control the
students and traffic in order to provide a safe time for
the students to cross. When a school crossing guard
is posted, drivers must stop when signalled to do so
by the crossing guard and remain stopped until the
crosswalk is clear and the guard has left the crosswalk.
SPECIAL CROSSWALKS
Overhead signs and flashing amber beacons provide
greater warning to drivers especially on

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals
multi-lane streets. When
special crosswalks are
installed and beacons are
activated by pedestrians,
the drivers must stop
before entering the
crosswalk when the
beacons are flashing.
CROSSWALKS WITH TRAFFIC SIGNALS
Where crosswalks are equipped with traffic signals, the
driver must respond to the traffic signals.
PAVEMENT MARKINGS
Pavement markings are placed on a highway to
indicate to the driver where the driving lanes are and
markings provide any additional information which
may be appropriate.

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals

YELLOW LINES
Yellow lines are used to separate traffic travelling in
the opposite directions. The yellow line must always
be on the left of the driver except when passing
another vehicle. Yellow lines are also used to mark the
left shoulder on ramps and multi-lane highways. Solid
yellow lines indicate that passing is not safe at the
location. Broken yellow lines indicate that passing is
permitted if there is no opposing traffic.

67
WHITE LINES
White lines are used to
separate traffic lanes in
the same direction and to
mark the right shoulder
line along the roadway.
Shoulder lines are solid
except at intersections
where they are turned onto the other roadway or
become broken at a ramp. Solid lines indicate that
lane changes should not be made. Broken lines
indicate that lane changes may occur with the proper
precautions.
White lane lines at intersections may be wider and
shorter with shorter spaces to emphasize that vehicles
will be merging, changing lanes, accelerating and
braking in order to make the desired manoeuvres.
Drivers should be alert to traffic changing lanes at
these locations.

68
DIAGONAL MARKINGS/CROSSHATCHES
Diagonal markings/crosshatches may be used in
advance of traffic islands, merging areas, lane
transitions or medians to warn traffic that the paved
area is not intended for use as a traffic lane. Drivers
should not use such areas as traffic lanes and should
observe the colour of the markings and keep to the
appropriate side.
STOP LINES
Stop lines may be painted on the highway’s surface at
intersections to indicate to a driver the appropriate
locations to stop. The driver should stop so that the
front of the vehicle does not extend beyond the stop
lines. Stop lines are always white. Stop signs do not
show where to stop.

Chapter 3: Traffic Signals
CROSSWALK LINES
Crosswalk lines
are painted on the
highway surface to
indicate the location
of a crosswalk. When
a stop is required and
there is a crosswalk
without a stop line, a driver must stop his/her vehicle
before any part of it extends into the crosswalk.
Crosswalk lines are always white.
INTERSECTION ARROWS
Intersection arrows may be used in advance of an
intersection to indicate which lane the driver must be
in to make a specific manoeuver. Intersection arrows
are always white.

Chapter 3: Traffic Signs

69

Along with traffic signal lights, traffic signs provide for
the safe and efficient movement of traffic. There are
several different types of traffic signs, including
regulatory, warning, construction and information
signs. The shape and colour of each sign, as well as the
message printed on it, carry a message for the driver.
For instance, red is used to indicate prohibited
manoeuvres while green designates permitted
movements. Stop signs always have an eight-sided
shape, yield signs are always triangular in shape and
speed limit signs are always a vertical rectangle. Each
shape carries a distinctive meaning so that if
darkness or falling rain or snow obscure the lettering,
the safety message can still be identified.

Chapter 4: Speed Limits, Following Distances and Driving Skills

A driver must not drive a vehicle on a highway at a
speed that is greater than is reasonable and prudent
according to the conditions and hazards on or near
the highway. A driver must exercise due care and
attention and reasonable consideration for other
people. A driver must control the speed of a vehicle to
avoid a collision with people, vehicles, animals or other
obstacles on the highway.
A driver of a motor vehicle must, when on a highway
and approaching or passing an animal, exercise
reasonable caution to avoid injuring the animal.
Speeding is risky, but the safest speed is not always
the slowest speed. If you drive much slower than
surrounding traffic, other drivers might get frustrated
and try to pass you. What you are aiming for is a
speed appropriate for the conditions in which you are
driving.

The maximum speed limit in Prince Edward Island
unless otherwise posted is 80 kilometres per hour
(km/h). The basic speed limits are:
• 40 km/h (25 mph) in most municipalities
(municipalities may establish the maximum
speed limit within their boundaries);
• 50 km/h (30 mph) in urban areas;
• 60 km/h (40 mph) in school zones designated as
such by the erection of signs at the entrance and
the exit, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. when
children are present on or near the highway on
school days;
• 80 km/h (50 mph) on most provincial highways;
and
• 90 km/h (55 mph) on the TransCanada and 		
other designated highways.
Posted speed limits indicate the maximum safe
speed under favourable driving conditions.

Chapter 4: Speed Limits, Following Distances and Driving Skills
A reduction in speed is essential when driving under
unfavourable conditions, such as:
• poor visibility, due to darkness, rain, fog or snow, etc;
• wet or slippery road surfaces;
• heavy traffic;
• pedestrians on or near the highway; or
• fatigue, illness or nervous tension on the part of
the driver.
SLOW DRIVING
A driver must not drive a vehicle at such a slow speed
as to impede or block the normal and reasonable
movement of traffic. If for some reason you must drive
slowly because of mechanical or other problems, it
is a matter of common sense and courtesy to:
• move over to the right lane and permit other traffic
to pass; or
• pull off the roadway and stop to allow traffic
to get by.

85

DRAG RACING
It is illegal to race or stunt drive a vehicle or bicycle
on any street or highway. This extremely dangerous
activity is prohibited. Drivers may lose their driving
privileges if convicted of this offence.
FOLLOWING DISTANCES – THE TIME-INTERVAL
FORMULA
The “Time-Interval Driving Method” will allow you to
calculate a safe following distance between your
vehicle and a vehicle ahead.
Under normal
conditions, follow at
a distance of at least
three seconds. When
the driver ahead of you
passes a fixed marker,
begin counting from
the back of the vehicle

86

Chapter 4: Speed Limits, Following Distances and Driving Skills

to the front of yours --- “one thousand and one, one
thousand and two, one thousand and three.” If you
reach the mark before you’ve finished counting, you
are following too closely. Ease off the accelerator
and check yourself again. Under normal conditions,
the three-second time-interval will provide you with
enough distance to stop.
Here’s what to do under other conditions:
When you are pulling a trailer, increase your time
interval to four seconds. You will need the extra time
and space to stop.
Motorcycles are light and can stop quickly. Allow
yourself another second or two of following distance
when following a motorcycle.
When driving under adverse weather, road or traffic
conditions, add more seconds to your following
distance to four or more seconds.

It is sometimes hard to estimate a reasonable distance
between your vehicle and the vehicle you are
following to be sure of having a safe space in which to
stop. The volume of traffic, road conditions and
traffic speed constantly demands adjustments in your
following distance.
To stop your vehicle, three separate acts are involved.
These are actions that involve only you, the driver.
1) You must see a reason for stopping. To see the
reason for an emergency stop calls for continual
close attention to road and traffic conditions.
2) You must react. Reaction time varies with individual
drivers but the average is about three-quarters of a
second. In three-quarters of a second a vehicle
traveling at 50 km/h (30 mph) will go 10 metres
(33 feet) or about two vehicle lengths before the
driver can start to apply the brakes.
3) You must then depress the brake pedal and bring
the vehicle to a complete stop.

Chapter 4: Speed Limits, Following Distances and Driving Skills
Remember that the total stopping distance also
depends on the efficiency of your brakes and tires and
the condition of the road surface.
The distance traveled before the brakes will stop the
vehicle depends on:
• the speed the car is being driven;
• the condition of the brakes;
• the condition of the tires;
• the condition of the road surface; or
• whether the vehicle is being driven on a level
highway or on a hill.
CAUTION: On wet or icy roads your vehicle cannot be
stopped as quickly as on dry roads. When slowing
or stopping, pump or apply the brakes quickly* (but
gently) and as quickly release them. Keep repeating
this on and off braking until you come to a full stop or
the speed you desire. Do not apply hard, steady
brake pressure as this will lock the wheels and start

you skidding. Always drive at a speed which will
enable you to stop within the clear, visible distance
ahead.
*Note: This does not apply to vehicles with ABS
(Antilock Braking Systems)

Chapter 4: Changing Lanes
CHANGING LANES
When you must change lanes always practice these
steps:
• make sure that you are not following other traffic
too closely;
• look in your rear-view mirror for traffic approaching
from the rear;
• look in your side-view mirrors for any traffic;
• signal your intention; and
• turn your head in the direction of your turn, and
check over your shoulder for cars that are too close
to be visible in your side rear-view mirror.
All vehicles have a
“blind spot” in the
right and left rear
corners. Your inside
rearview mirror will
not show a vehicle in
the lane next to yours,

89
when the front bumper is about even with, or past your
rear bumper.
SIGNALS AND CHANGING LANES
One of the most fundamental principles of safe driving
is using reasonable care and signalling before turning,
changing lanes or stopping. Giving signals properly
and in sufficient time is an important practice. The
proper signals are simple and can be easily learned.
Moreover, all vehicles made during or after 1971 must
be equipped with signal lights, which makes signalling
even easier. To be effective, signals must be given in
sufficient time to warn other drivers of your intentions;
in the city signal 30 metres (100 feet) in advance of a
turn or stop. On highways where traffic travels at much
higher speeds, signals should be given at least 150
metres (500 feet) before turning or stopping. Even if
your vehicle is equipped with a signalling device, know
the proper hand signals.

90
You are required to give a signal before:
• changing from one lane to another;
• turning;
• pulling over to stop;
• pulling out from a parked position; or
• attempting to pass, and after you have passed and
are moving back into the right lane.
Make it a practice to give signals at all times. If you
misjudge a situation, at least the other driver will be
better prepared to avoid a collision.

Chapter 4: Changing Lanes
HAND SIGNALS

Chapter 4: Turning
TURNING AT INTERSECTIONS
These are the steps for making safe, courteous and
legal turns.
• Prepare for the turn before you get there. Decide
well ahead where you want to turn. If you are not
sure, drive slowly until you can read the street signs
or markers or decide in some other way the
direction you desire to turn. Never make last-minute
turns; they are dangerous.
• Get into the correct lane as soon as possible. You
should get into the proper lane sooner in fastmoving and/or heavy traffic.
• Look behind and on both sides to see where other
traffic may be so that you can change lanes and
make the turn safely.
• Signal your intention to change lanes and to turn.
• If you are going faster than is safe to make the turn,
slow down before you reach the crosswalk and
complete the turn at the same speed at which you

91
enter the intersection. Do not have the brake or
clutch pedal pushed down or shift gears while
actually turning but be prepared to do so.
• Finish the turn in the proper lane.

92
LEFT TURNS
Drivers making left turns must be alert for pedestrians
and other traffic. Pedestrians in a crosswalk have
the right-of-way to proceed across the street. The
driver turning left must watch not only for traffic
approaching from the opposite direction, but also for
any other vehicles that may be entering the
intersection.
When turning left into a lane or driveway, make sure
that you:
• are in the proper lane for a left turn;
• have given a signal for a sufficient distance; or
• yield to oncoming traffic (oncoming vehicles have
the right-of-way even if you have reached the
turning point first).
CAUTION: If you have stopped to make a left turn, and
must wait for oncoming traffic, do not turn the
steering wheel to the left until you are ready to

Chapter 4: Turning
complete the turn. If you are struck from the rear while
stopped with the wheels turned to the left, your
car may be pushed into oncoming traffic and cause
another collision.
Turning left on highways presents special problems
due to the high speeds of other vehicles. When you
make a left turn on a highway, remember to stay on
your side of the center line until you are ready to
begin the turn. Watch for cars that may be passing you,
and signal to give other drivers ample warning.

RIGHT TURNS ON A RED LIGHT
Unless forbidden by a sign at the intersection, drivers
are permitted to make a right turn on a red light after
coming to a complete stop. This procedure, when
carried out with certain precautions, contributes to the
smooth, orderly and safe movement of traffic in urban
areas.
The following steps will apply:
• come to a complete stop at the intersection;
• check for other motor vehicles and pedestrians
who have a prior right to use the intersection at
that time and yield to them; and
• proceed with caution if the way is completely clear.
It is both dangerous and illegal to make a right turn
on a red light without first coming to a complete
stop and yielding to other traffic and pedestrians
using the intersection.

MAKING U-TURNS
U-turns are hazardous.
U-turns are permitted:
• between intersections in a municipality if a local
bylaw permits them; and
• on a highway if you can be seen by traffic
approaching from either direction within 150
metres (500 feet).
U-turns are not permitted:
• in a municipality at an intersection which is
controlled by traffic lights;
• at any place or intersection where a sign
prohibits them; or
• on a curve, near the crest of a hill or at any point
where such a turn would interfere with other traffic.

Chapter 4: Passing Other Vehicles
LEARN THESE RULES FOR SAFE PASSING AND
PRACTICE THEM AT ALL TIMES
You must not pass:
• at an intersection, if it would be necessary to cross
over the solid centre line. If the car ahead is
signaling for a right or left turn, you may cautiously
pass on the side opposite the direction of the turn
but you must not cross over a solid yellow line;
• at any crosswalk or any other place where a car has
stopped to yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian or
other vehicle;
• in a school zone;
• on the right side of a vehicle except on a street with
two or more lanes in the same direction;
• when you have to drive on the left side of the
roadway to pass and there is not sufficient clear
road ahead to pass safely; or
• in a posted no passing zone.

95
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DRIVER BEING PASSED
If you are the driver being passed, you have
responsibilities. These responsibilities are:
• whenever the driver behind sounds the horn and
signals with lights that he or she wants to pass,
move to the right and do not change into a left lane
until the vehicle has passed; and
• never speed up when being passed;
To reduce the risk of a head-on collision follow these
suggestions:
• when another vehicle is passing you, look ahead to
make sure that there will be no danger of collision
or being cut off by the passing vehicle;
• in heavy traffic, watch for drivers who insist on
passing even at the risk of a collision; and
• check your rear-view mirror regularly.

96
SAFE PASSING PRACTICES
Head-on collisions, sideswiping and rear-end collisions
are caused by improper and unsafe passing practices.
Develop safe passing practices. These are some
suggestions:
• Pay close attention to the distance between you
and the vehicle ahead.
• Don’t try to pass in heavy traffic.
• Don’t take unnecessary risks in an attempt to be
“the first in line.”
• Keep a safe following distance before passing.
Moving up closely behind a vehicle obscures your
view of the road ahead and it becomes necessary to
pull out sharply to pass.
• Never pull out to pass behind another vehicle that
is also passing. The driver ahead may not realize
that two cars are passing and may not adjust his
or her speed. Wait until the first car has completely
passed and your view is unobstructed.

Chapter 4: Passing Other Vehicles
• Check your speed. High speeds and frequent
passing go hand-in-hand.
NOTE: Remember, when passing, the law requires that
you signal your intention and sound your horn.

Chapter 4: School Buses
School buses are specially marked and equipped with
alternating amber and red flashing lights.
Alternating flashing AMBER lights are displayed
before the school bus stops to pick up or let off
students. You should be ALERT for students when
these lights are flashing and be prepared to stop. and
you shall reduce speed and proceed with caution and
you may pass the bus only with caution.
Alternating flashing RED lights are used when the
school bus is stopped to pick up or let off students.
When you are approaching a school bus with the
FLASHING RED LIGHTS activated, you must stop your
vehicle not less than 6 metres (20 feet) from the front
or rear of the bus. Remain stopped until the flashing
red lights stop flashing. IT IS ILLEGAL TO PASS a
school bus when the alternating flashing RED lights
are displayed.

97
Note: Passing a school bus when the red lights are
flashing could result in a charge under the Highway
Traffic Act.

Chapter 4: Heavy Vehicles - The No-Zones

WHAT ARE THE NO-ZONES?
No-Zones are danger areas around trucks and buses
where crashes are more likely to occur. Some of
these No-Zones are actual blind spots where your car
“disappears” from the view of the truck or bus driver.
Truck and bus drivers can’t always see certain areas
around their vehicles. The size of heavy vehicles
increases the risk of collision in those areas. When you
are driving your car through a heavy vehicle No-Zone,
please drive with care.
SIDE NO-ZONES
Trucks and buses have big blind spots on both sides. If
you can’t see the driver’s face in the side-view mirror,
he or she can’t see you. If that driver needs to change
lanes for any reason, you could have a collision.

Chapter 4: Heavy Vehicles - The No-Zones
REAR NO-ZONES
Unlike cars, trucks and buses have huge No-Zones
directly behind them. Truck or bus drivers can’t see
your car behind them, and you can’t see what’s going
on ahead of you. If the truck or bus drivers brake
suddenly, you may collide. Maintain a safe following
distance at all times.
FRONT NO-ZONES
Don’t cut in front too soon after passing. Truck and bus
drivers need nearly twice the time and room to
stop as cars. Look for the whole front of the truck in
your rear-view mirror before pulling in front, and then
don’t slow down.
BACKING UP IN NO-ZONES
Never cross behind a truck that is backing up. Truck
drivers may not see you cutting in behind them.

99

WIDE RIGHT TURNS
Truck and bus drivers sometimes need to swing wide
to the left in order to safely make a right turn. They
can’t see cars squeezing in between them and the
curb. Watch for their signal lights and give them room
to turn.
Remember:
• don’t “hang out” on either side of trucks or buses;
• avoid tailgating;
• pass safely;
• never cross behind a truck that is backing up.

Chapter 4: Meeting Oncoming Traffic & Parking Regulations

There are certain rules for drivers going in opposite
directions and meeting each other.
• The basic rule is to keep your vehicle in your half of
the roadway. Never permit your vehicle to wander
into another traffic lane; you should drive in the 		
centre of your lane of traffic except when passing or
turning.
• When meeting another vehicle on a narrow street
or road, BOTH drivers must slow down or stop, and
assist one another to pass safely. On streets that are
made narrow by parked vehicles, watch for
oncoming vehicles. If the parked vehicles are on
your half of the road, move into a gap whenever
possible.
• You should not drive in the city with your high
beams on unless they are required for safety. On the
highway, when meeting other traffic you must dim
your lights when you are within 150 metres
(500 feet) of the other car.

PARKING
REGULATIONS
It is illegal to stop or
park a vehicle:
• in front of a private
driveway, lane or
intersection;
• within 2.5 metres
(8 feet) of a fire
hydrant;
• on a crosswalk;
• within six metres
(20 feet) of the
approach to a crosswalk;
• on the roadway side of another vehicle that is
already stopped or parked (double parking);
• so that it obstructs traffic or constitutes a
hazard to others;

Chapter 4: Parking and Stopping
• within 15 metres
(50 feet) of the nearest
rail of a railway crossing;
• within 12 metres
(40 feet) of a stop sign or
traffic signal; and
• in a space designated for
the disabled unless the
vehicle has a valid emblem approved by Highway
Safety Division and The Council of the Disabled that
clearly identifies the vehicle is owned, operated
by or used for transportation of a disabled person.
Violation of this law will result in a fine.
The following parking rules also apply:
• where parallel parking is permitted, you must have
the vehicle’s wheels within 0.3 metres (12 inches) of
the curb;

101
• you must set your hand or foot brake, stop the motor
and remove the keys from the ignition; and
• when getting out of a vehicle on the left side, or the
right side on a one-way street, always look before
opening the door. A passing cyclist or another car
may strike the door, or pin you against the vehicle.
On a highway never park or stop on a travelled lane
unless your vehicle is so disabled that you cannot
move it. If for any reason you cannot move your
vehicle off the highway, always turn on your parking
lights or hazard lights when visibility is poor. But most
important, get the vehicle off the highway as soon as
possible.
If you have to stop or park at night on the highway,
pull over as far to the right as you can. Turn on your
parking or hazard lights. Do not stand on the highway
if you have to make repairs or change a flat tire. Carry
a warning signal light which you can put on the

102
shoulder of the road behind your vehicle. Buses,
heavy commercial vehicles and trucks must carry
flares or warning lamps, which must be placed at least
60 metres (200 feet) in front of and to the rear
of the vehicle.
STEPS IN PARALLEL PARKING
• Stop even with the car ahead about 0.45 metres
(1.5 feet) away from it.
• Back slowly, turning the wheel sharply to the right
until the car is at a 45-degree angle with the curb,
then straighten the wheels.
• Back slowly until the left headlight of the rear car is
visible; then turn the wheels sharply to the left and
again back slowly.
• Turn wheel sharply to the right and pull forward to
the centre of the parking space.

Chapter 4: Parking and Stopping
ANGLE PARKING
Drive forward into the space, with equal space on each
side between the lines.

Chapter 4: Parking and Stopping

103

Follow these steps when moving your car from a
parked position:
• check for other traffic;
• signal your intention to pull away from the curb;
and
• pull away when it is safe to do so and when you do
not interfere with other traffic.

104
Although backing forms a minor portion of driving,
it deserves particular attention because it is an
especially hazardous movement. A driver’s blind spot
keeps him or her from being completely aware of
everything in the path of his or her vehicle when
backing up. The law requires that a driver must not
back a vehicle unless the movement can be made
safely and without interfering with traffic.
STEPS IN BACKING
• Check all around the vehicle before you get in the
vehicle.
• Look out the rear window.
• Sound the horn immediately before backing, to
alert any pedestrians you may have missed.
• Back up slowly.
• Check both sides as you back up.
• When backing from a driveway, check for
pedestrian and vehicle traffic before crossing the
sidewalk and entering the roadway.

Chapter 4: Backing
• Backing is permitted only when safe to do so.

Chapter 4: Driving in a Village, Town or City
Things to remember when driving in a village, town or
city:
• Watch for pedestrians and other vehicles when
approaching any intersection.
• Obey the speed limits. At a higher speed you may
be unable to stop when necessary.
• Plan your route ahead so that you will be in the
proper lane for any turns you may have to make.
Signal well in advance.
• If you are parked at a curb, do not pull away until
you have signaled, checked for other traffic and are
sure you can do so safely.
• Be alert for signs and signals.
• Slow down in residential areas and watch for
children and bicyclists.
• If you must drive at a slower speed than the flow of
traffic, keep to the right lane.
• Keep your speed down in lanes and alleys. Stop
before you enter a street from a lane or alley.

105

• Do not block an intersection. If your lane beyond
the intersection is blocked with traffic, stop before
entering it and wait until the traffic ahead moves.
• Do not “weave” in traffic. When you have to change
lanes, signal and watch for traffic behind you.
• Do not follow other vehicles too closely.

106
ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION LANES
Some highways have speed-up or acceleration lanes.
First enter the acceleration lane; then increase your
speed, signal and
move over to the
regular traffic lane
when your speed
and traffic permits.
This will enable you
to merge smoothly
with the other traffic.
Some highways also have lanes provided for
decelerating, or slowing down before turning off
the highway. Always signal before entering the
deceleration lane, and slow down after you have
entered it.

Chapter 4: Driving on the Highway
MERGING
Merging requires
that you time your
approach and
smoothly blend in
with the other traffic.
This may require
adjusting your speed
so that when you reach the end of the acceleration
lane, you have a gap in the traffic which will permit
you to enter the flow of traffic safely. Your entry into
that flow should be at, or near, the speed of the other
traffic.
Do not slow down or come to a stop at the end of the
acceleration lane. The acceleration lane is designed
for you to bring your vehicle up to the speed of the
highway traffic. The drivers behind you are expecting
you to continue. Slowing down or stopping may cause
your vehicle to be rear-ended.

Chapter 4: Driving on the Highway
Here are some tips for safe merging:
• check the traffic flow that is on the highway;
• choose your entry position;
• as your vehicle enters the acceleration lane, signal;
• accelerate to the speed of the highway traffic;
• keep checking the gap and any following vehicles;
• pull into the gap; and
• turn off your signal light.
Drivers already on the highway should, when
approaching an acceleration lane, slow down and
leave a gap for the merging vehicle or move over
to the left-hand lane if there are two or more lanes
travelling in the same direction, if it is safe to do so,
leaving the right travel lane clear for the merging
vehicles. Remember, be courteous and allow the
merging driver to enter the highway.

107
SOFT OR LOW SHOULDERS
If one or more wheels of your vehicle suddenly drops
off the edge of the pavement onto a soft or low dirt
shoulder, follow these four steps to keep control and
return to the pavement safely:
• Steer firmly. Hold the wheel with both hands.
Straddle the edge with one side of the vehicle on
the pavement and the other side on the shoulder.
• Slow down gradually. Lift your foot from the
accelerator, but don’t brake.
• Ease to a slower speed.
• Return to the pavement at a 45-degree angle when
the vehicle has slowed enough to give you
complete control over it. Don’t allow the side of the
tires to rub against the pavement edge. Returning
to the pavement at too high a speed may cause the
vehicle to swerve into the lane of oncoming traffic.
• Straighten out the vehicle in the correct lane of
traffic.

108
Note: You may have to continue on the shoulder of the
road until the shoulder and road are at an even level.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF A COLLISION
• Stay alert and attentive.
• Stop driving when tired.
• Adjust speed to conditions.
• Maintain a safe following distance.
• Follow proper procedures for passing, turning and
changing lanes.
• Drive in the right lane of a four-lane highway when
not passing.
• At dusk, turn on your headlights to help other
drivers see you.

Chapter 4: Roundabouts – How They Work

109

SINGLE-LANE ROUNDABOUTS
Motorized Vehicles
• Vehicles entering the roundabout must always yield to traffic already in the roundabout and to pedestrians.
• All vehicles must travel in a counterclockwise direction.

Left Turns:

Vehicles turning left or performing a U-turn must
signal left before entering the roundabout and
signal right before exiting the roundabout.

Going Straight:

Vehicles going straight must not
signal before entering the roundabout. They should
signal right before exiting the roundabout.

Right Turns:

Vehicles turning right must signal right and
maintain the signal until they have exited
the roundabout.

110

Chapter 4: Roundabouts – How They Work

DUAL-LANE ROUNDABOUTS
Motorized Vehicles
• Vehicles entering the roundabout must always yield to traffic already in the roundabout and to pedestrians.
• Vehicles should not enter a roundabout alongside another vehicle already in the roundabout.
• Vehicles must remain in their lane until exiting the roundabout and should not change lanes while in the
roundabout.
• All vehicles must travel in a counterclockwise direction.

Left Turns:

Vehicles turning left or performing a U-turn must be in the left-hand lane. They
must signal left before entering the roundabout and signal right before exiting
the roundabout.

Going Straight:

Vehicles going straight can be in the left- or right-hand lanes. They must not
signal before entering the roundabout. They should signal right before exiting
the roundabout.

Chapter 4: Roundabouts – How They Work
•

Crosswalks at modern roundabouts have two
sections and, in some cases, two lanes to cross at
each section. Pedestrians must ensure both lanes
of traffic are yielding. Cross the first section to the
splitter island, stop, make sure traffic is yielding to
you, then cross the second section.

•

Always try to make eye contact with drivers to
ensure they acknowledge that you are going to

cross and that they are yielding to you.

Right Turns:

Vehicles turning right must be in the right-hand lane. They must signal
right and maintain the signal until they have exited the roundabout.

Pedestrians
Rules for pedestrians are the same in a roundabout as
they are at all other crosswalks on the road. But there
are a few things to keep in mind:
Signal your intention to cross by extending your arm.

111

Bicycles
Cyclists have two options:
•

First, they can use the roundabout with the same
rules as a vehicle and travel in the centre of the
appropriate lane.

•

Second, they can leave the road at the
crosswalk, get off their bicycle and navigate the
roundabout as a pedestrian would.

112
LIGHTS
There are three times as many fatal collisions at night
as there are during daylight hours. Night driving is
more dangerous because the distance you can see
ahead is greatly reduced. Have your lights aimed
regularly. Remember, you cannot see as well at night.
Reduce your speed so as not to “over-drive” your
headlights. If you are travelling at a speed which does
not permit you to see an object in time to stop, you
are over-driving your headlights.
SPEED
On the highway, if road conditions are poor, or
visibility is reduced, you should slow down to a speed
that will allow you to stop within the distance you can
see. In cities or towns with restricted speed zones,
the speed limit does not change at night, but visibility
does so you should slow down. When driving in
residential areas, slow down and watch for pedestrians

Chapter 4: Night Driving
or other road users who may be difficult to see at
night.
HIGH AND LOW HEADLIGHT BEAMS
The law requires motor vehicle headlights to be
turned on from sunset to sunrise or when visibility
is poor. When you need to use lights, use your
headlights; parking lights are for parking only. Use
LOW beams in city driving, except in areas which are
not lighted and where traffic permits.
When meeting an oncoming vehicle DIM your lights
when within 150 metres (500 feet), of the other
vehicle. Do not wait for the other driver to dim his/her
lights first. When switching to low beams, remove
your foot from the gas pedal to reduce speed in order
to give your eyes a chance to adjust to the change in
light. To avoid being blinded watch the right edge of
the roadway; if you are blinded, always slow down

Chapter 4: Night Driving

113

when meeting another vehicle. When following a
vehicle, use your LOW beam when within 60 metres
(200 feet) of it. If you do not, your bright lights will
reflect from the rear-view mirror and blind the driver
in front.
HIGH AND LOW HEADLIGHT BEAMS (EXAMPLE)

114
To prepare for winter driving have these items
carefully checked and repaired if necessary:
• THE RADIATOR
Check for leaks and put in antifreeze.
• THE TIRES
Check tires and replace any damaged or “bald” tires.
Studded tires may be used between October 1 and
May 31. It is unlawful to use them at any other
time. Studded tires greatly improve traction and
shorten stopping distance on slippery roads.
• THE BRAKES
Have brakes adjusted or relined if necessary. Be sure
your four brakes are braking equally. On icy roads
poorly adjusted brakes can throw your car into a
dangerous skid.

Chapter 4: Winter Driving
• THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND HEATER
DEFROSTER
Be sure your wiper blades are in good condition at
all times. Check your heater defroster unit to be sure
it is in good working order.
• THE MUFFLER
Have it checked for leaks. A leaking muffler or
exhaust system can create a carbon monoxide
hazard, particularly if you are stalled in traffic or in a
blizzard. Never start your car in a closed garage.
TIPS FOR SAFE WINTER DRIVING
• SLOW DOWN
Slow down whenever roads are icy or covered with
snow. Keep well back of the vehicle ahead. It takes
from three to 12 times more distance to stop on
snow and ice than it does on dry pavement.

Chapter 4: Winter Driving
• GET THE “FEEL” OF THE ROAD
The road may be more slippery than you think.
When traffic permits, apply your brakes to see how
well they hold.
• BE ALERT
a) Watch out for pedestrians. They are cold and in
			 a hurry. Extend every courtesy to them.
b) In early fall and late spring, shaded spots on the
			 highway retain frost and ice much longer and
			 may be slippery.
c) Watch for snowdrifts and patches of icy
			 surfaces. Hitting a snow drift or icy patch at
			 high speed can throw your vehicle out of
			 control.
• BRAKING CAREFULLY
To stop or slow down on icy roads, gently apply
your brakes. Probably no single action causes
more skids and collisions than locking the brakes.

115
By pressing hard on the brakes you simply lock the
wheels and turn your vehicle into a “toboggan.”
(This does not apply if your car is equipped with an
anti-lock brake system.) Once you lock your wheels
you lose traction and steering ability. With power
brakes you have to be even more careful so as not
to lock your wheels on icy roads.
ANTILOCK BRAKE SYSTEMS (ABS)
Antilock brake system is an advanced electronic
braking system that will prevent skidding. When you
need to stop, don’t pump the brakes. Just hold the
brake pedal down. With ABS, you can steer and brake
at the same time; however, any type of braking system
requires the driver to use good judgment and
extra caution to avoid collisions. If your vehicle is
equipped with ABS, consult your owner’s manual for
more information.

116
BLACK ICE
Black ice is a very dangerous road condition. It occurs
when the road is wet and the temperature drops to
or below the freezing level. This can also occur at
anytime during the winter months where water may
freeze into ice. Black ice is very difficult to see or may
not be seen at all. Please be aware that icy conditions
may occur without warning or any visible appearance.
BRIDGE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD
During the winter months, bridges will have ice on the
road surface before ice forms on the highway. Please
use caution when approaching bridges during winter.
WINTER KIT
Here are some helpful things you might carry in your
car in winter:
• a blanket and extra clothing;

Chapter 4: Winter Driving
• a heat source (candle, matches, deep can to hold
the candle);
• nonperishable food, candy, nuts;
• shovel;
• hatchet or axe;
• inflated spare tire and jack;
• sand, salt;
• approved warning devices;
• tow rope;
• first aid kit;
• ice scraper, snow brush;
• methyl hydrate (gas line antifreeze);
• tire chains;
• a flashlight with spare batteries;
• jumper cables; and
• if you have a cellular phone, carry it with you.
If your vehicle battery fails, consult your vehicle
owner’s manual for proper instructions for boosting
your vehicle battery.

Chapter 4: Winter Driving
If you find yourself stranded, stay with your vehicle.
Run the engine just often enough to keep yourself
warm. Keep the vehicle ventilated by opening a
window slightly while the engine is running to prevent
carbon monoxide poisoning. Save your energy and be
patient. You are safer and more likely to be found
if you stay with the vehicle.
STEERING
Never make any sudden and sharp turns on slippery
roads, a dangerous skid could result. Steering
becomes very easy during a skid — almost like power
steering. Try to anticipate your turns and start slowing
down well before you reach the intersection or curve
on the highway.
STARTING
Another common cause of collisions is misjudgment

117
by drivers of the time it will take them to cross an
intersection from a complete stop. Often drivers
who start from a stop sign or traffic light cannot get
across the intersection in time. Never spin your wheels
when starting. Spinning tires melt snow, turning it
into ice. With standard transmission put your car into
second gear when on icy roads. Then gently press the
accelerator pedal until your car starts to roll. The first
sign of spinning means too much gas, ease off a bit.
With automatic transmission, apply gentle pressure on
the accelerator, just enough to start your car rolling.
You will also have to allow for the longer start by
looking for greater gaps in traffic. Remember that just
as it will take you longer to start, the other driver will
require a longer distance to stop for you.
OTHER CAUSES OF SKIDDING
• Driving too fast on bumpy roads, or when crossing a
road crown, railway tracks or icy ruts.

118
• Driving on the edge of the road. If one wheel drops
off the pavement onto the shoulder, a skid may
result.
• Changing to lower gear at too fast a speed. The
sudden deceleration caused by the compression of
your motor may throw you into a skid.
HOW TO RECOVER FROM A SKID
In case your vehicle does go into a skid, learn how to
recover from it:
• keep calm and keep control of yourself, but act
promptly;
• if the skid was caused by slamming on the brakes,
ease off the brakes and steer in the direction in
which the rear end is skidding. Do not oversteer;
• if the skid was caused by accelerating too fast, ease
up on the gas pedal and steer in the direction of the
skid;
• when the skid is caused by driving too fast over a

Chapter 4: Winter Driving
bumpy road surface
or icy ruts, take your
foot off the gas
pedal, but do not
apply brakes, and
steer gently but
firmly;
• if the skid was
caused by gearing
down at too fast
a speed, shift back into high gear, steering in the
direction of the skid at the same time;
• when the skid occurs at slow speeds due
to improper braking or steering, moderate
acceleration may aid in recovering from it. This
should be resorted to only if all else fails; and
• if your tire blows out, make sure that you have a
firm grip on the steering wheel. Do not drive with
one hand.

Chapter 4: Highway, Weather and Visibility Conditions
FRONT WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES (FWDV)
Experienced FWDV drivers may find that gentle
acceleration will help the vehicle pull out of a rear
wheel skid. If the front wheels skid, take your foot
off the accelerator. The engine braking effect may
slow the car to the point where front end traction is
regained. If the skid continues, depress the clutch or
select neutral. Freely rolling wheels are better able to
regain traction.
DRIVING IN THE RAIN
Roads are likely to be especially slippery JUST AFTER IT
BEGINS TO RAIN. The first few drops loosen the grease
and dirt accumulated on the surface of the road. The
loosened grease and dirt mix with the raindrops and
the road is quickly covered with a slippery film that
makes it extremely dangerous. The first few drops of
rain are danger signals telling you to slow down and
use extra caution.

119

HYDROPLANING — “Water Skiing on the
Highway”
Hydroplaning takes place on wet roads. As speed
increases, your tires start to ride up on a film of water.
In a standard passenger car, partial hydroplaning starts
at about 60 km/h (35 mph), and increases with speed
to about 90 km/h (55 mph), at which point the tires
may be totally up on the water. In a severe rainstorm
the tires lose all contact with the road at 90 km/h (55
mph). When this is the case, there is no friction
available to brake, accelerate or turn. A gust of wind, a
change of road conditions or a slight turn can create
an unpredictable and uncontrollable skid. The best
thing to do is to take your foot off the accelerator and
let the car slow down. If you skid while your car is only
partially hydroplaning, you should be able to regain
control by correcting for the particular type of skid. On
the other hand, if you’re totally hydroplaning, all you
can do is release the accelerator and ride out the skid.

120

Chapter 4: Highway, Weather and Visibility Conditions

To prevent hydroplaning, it is most helpful to have
good tires with deep treads. The treads allow the water
to escape from under the tires and tend to prevent
complete hydroplaning at normal speeds; however,
when the depth of the water exceeds the depth of the
treads, complete hydroplaning can be expected at
speeds from 80 to 90 km/h (50 to 55 mph).
VISIBILITY
The law requires that the driver have a clear
unobstructed line of vision. All windows must be
kept free of dirt, condensation, ice and snow. Clean
your windows before every trip and stop to clean
them whenever conditions require it. It is illegal to
drive your vehicle when your vision is completely or
partially obstructed. Ornaments or decorations on
any part of the vehicle which obstruct the driver’s
vision or distract his or her attention are prohibited.
No more than two adult passengers and the driver

are permitted in the front seat. Any load within the
vehicle, including passengers, must not obstruct the
driver’s vision to the front, sides or rear of the vehicle.
Clear and unobstructed vision is always essential for a
driver, but in adverse weather conditions, good
vision becomes even more important. In fog, rain or
snow, always turn your headlights on low beams. High
beams will only reflect off fog or snow and hamper
your vision and that of approaching drivers. If your
vehicle is equipped with fog lights, use them when
driving in fog.
DRIVER DISTRACTIONS
Be familiar with the equipment in your car, such as the
stereo system and cell phone. This is especially
important if you have a new phone or car, or a rental
vehicle. Practice before driving so you can perform
basic functions without taking your eyes off the road.

Chapter 4: Driving Distractions
Program your favourite stations into the radio for easy
access. Arrange tapes and CDs in an easy-to-reach
spot.
• Keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the
road. If you choose to use your wireless phone, you
must use a hands-free device and keep it in its
holder.
• Make sure your children are comfortable and
properly buckled up. To keep children from
distracting the driver, provide them with safe items
they may need for the road trip. Teach your children
the importance of good behaviour while in a 		
vehicle. Don’t underestimate how distracting it can
be to tend to them in the car.
• Pull over to eat or drink. By stopping, you can give
yourself a break from the traffic and enjoy your
refreshments. Children or adults may choke on food
while in the vehicle, causing a severe distraction for

121
the driver. Avoid eating while driving, but if you
must, choose easy-to-handle items and make sure
all drinks are secured in cup holders.
• Check your route before leaving. If you are
unfamiliar with where you’re going, study a road
map to avoid unnecessary stress and distractions.
Do not attempt to read the road map while driving.
• Complete your grooming before leaving. Don’t
rely on the time in your vehicle to take care of your
personal routine such as applying makeup,
combing your hair or shaving. Don’t try to retrieve
items that fall to the floor while driving. Wait until
your vehicle is parked.
• Do not engage in emotionally charged
conversations either with the passengers or on your
mobile phone. Such discussions can result in
aggressive or erratic driving behaviour.

122
• Never take notes while driving. Always find a safe
place to stop before writing things down. Designate
a front-seat passenger to serve as “co-pilot” rather
than fumble with maps or unfamiliar navigation
systems.
• Drive defensively. Be prepared for the unsafe
actions of other motorists or for poor driving
conditions. If you find yourself ‘lost in thought’ while
driving, take a break.
• Tired driving. Don’t begin your trip unless you are
well rested. Dozing off behind the wheel for just
two to three seconds can be deadly. If you’re driving
90 km per hour, your car can travel the length of a
football field in three seconds.
• Heavy traffic. Plan your drive times to avoid the
“rush hours” of people leaving the city. Agitation can

Chapter 4: Driving Distractions
lead to aggressive driving behaviours like tailgating
and speeding. Remember, every other driver on the
road is subject to the same stress, fatigue, anger and
distractions that you are.
• Oncoming traffic. Be alert for unanticipated
movements like a car drifting across the centre line
or cutting into your lane. Be prepared to drive
calmly into the ditch if necessary to avoid a crash.
Don’t panic and try to oversteer – this can lead to
a rollover. Approach intersections with caution. Just
because you have the right-of-way doesn’t mean
the other drivers will stop.
• Breaks. Schedule frequent rest breaks for your
passengers as well as yourself. If children are bored
and restless, they can be distracting. Driver
distraction is a leading cause of motor vehicle
crashes.

Chapter 4: Driving Distractions
• Stopping. Always stop at stop signs – whether or
not you can see there are any vehicles coming. Fatal
crashes can happen because someone didn’t stop
because they were certain the “coast was clear.”
BAN ON HAND HELD CELL PHONES FOR DRIVERS
• It’s now the law – it is illegal to text, dial, chat, email
or search using a hand-held communication device
while driving in Prince Edward Island.
• Fines will range from $250 to $400 and three
demerit points upon conviction.
• Under the new cell phone law, no one shall drive a
motor vehicle on a highway while holding or using
a hand-held wireless communication device that
is capable of receiving or transmitting telephone
communications, electronic data, email or text
messages.
• Such devices include cellular phones, BlackBerrys,
Iphones, 10-4 phones, GPS systems or laptops.

123
• Drivers can use hands-free technology activated by
a single touch to a button, or when it is safe to do
so, drivers can pull over and stop the vehicle to talk
or email.
• Calls to 911 are exempt as are calls from the driver
of an ambulance, fire department vehicle or police
vehicle.

124
DRUGS
It is essential to understand the effects of any drug
you are taking before operating a motor vehicle.
Mood-altering (psychoactive) drugs are of particular
concern because they can change the way you think,
behave and physically respond. The following is a
partial list of mood-altering drugs:
Depressants:
• Alcohol
• Sedatives (Halcion)
• Minor tranquillizers (Valium, Ativan)
• Narcotic analgesics (heroin, morphine, codeine,
Talwin)
Stimulants:
• Amphetamines
• Cocaine

Chapter 4: Impaired Driving
Other:
• Hallucinogens (LSD, MDA, mescaline)
• Cannabis (marijuana, hashish)
Some prescription mood-altering drugs include
antidepressants such as Prozac and other medications
for depression, manic depression and psychosis. For
information on the effects and potential side effects of
a mood-altering drug ask your pharmacist or doctor.
ALCOHOL
Alcohol abuse is the most common type of drug
problem in Canada and North America. Alcohol
impairment continues to be a leading cause of traffic
fatalities.
It is important that all drivers understand the danger
of drinking and driving and the laws and penalties
involved.

Chapter 4: Impaired Driving
Driving after drinking is an irresponsible act. It
disregards the safety of others. Many people do not
understand the effects of alcohol on the mind and
body.
There has been a lot of research on the effect
of alcohol on people. All of these studies have
demonstrated that even in small amounts, alcohol has
a deteriorating effect on people. Despite the scientific
evidence that alcohol impairs the ability of all drivers,
drinking and driving is still a major safety problem.
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL
Reduced vision
Experiments show that alcohol has the same effect on
vision as a grey glass in front of the eyes, or driving
with sun glasses at dusk or in darkness. These tests
show a person who had the equivalent of four ounces
of alcohol needs a stronger light to see objects clearly.

125
Dimly lit objects are not seen at all. Drivers who have
been drinking and who are blinded by glaring light
take longer to recover their normal vision than drivers
who have not been drinking.
Slower reaction time
After seeing an object, such as a child running into the
path of a car, the average reaction time for taking
the foot off the gas pedal and putting it on the brake
is about three quarters of a second. Tests show that a
driver who is alcohol impaired, but not drunk, has his
or her reaction slowed down by 20%.
At a speed of 50 km/h (30 mph) a car travels
approximately 14 metres per second (44 feet per
second). In three-quarters of a second the car will
travel about 10.5 metres (33 feet). It will take a
drinking driver nearly one second to apply the brakes

126
and in that time the car will travel 3.5 metres (11 feet)
farther – perhaps enough to cause an accident. At a
speed of 100 km/h (60 mph), a vehicle will travel about
six metres (22 feet) farther before the impaired driver
applies the brakes.
Alcohol and collisions
Drinking and driving is one of the major causes of
traffic collisions. Studies conclusively prove that drivers
who drink and drive are involved in 10 times as many
collisions as drivers who are sober. Collisions involving
a drinking driver are more likely to be serious. This is
understandable, since a drinking driver tends to drive
faster and has impaired vision, judgment and
reaction time.
The result is that he or she may strike a pedestrian,
other vehicles or lose control of the vehicle even at
slower speeds.

Chapter 4: Impaired Driving
A conviction for impaired driving in Prince Edward
Island with a blood alcohol count (BAC) in excess of
.08 or refusal to take a blood/alcohol test will result in
the cancellation and a disqualification from holding or
obtaining a licence for a period of:
• one year for a first offence;
• three years for a second offence; and
• five years for a third or subsequent offence.
THE EFFECT OF MIXING ALCOHOL AND OTHER
DRUGS
Mixing alcohol with other drugs can cause a serious
reaction. This is especially dangerous when the use
of a motor vehicle is involved.
For example:
Two drinks of an alcoholic beverage in combination
with one normal dose of a common tranquilizer

Chapter 4: Impaired Driving
equals the impairment level produced by six drinks.
Remember that one bottle of beer is equal to
1¼ ounces of liquor or four ounces of wine.
Two drinks of an alcoholic beverage and one light
dose of marijuana can equal the impairment produced
by five drinks.
If you are taking medication or a drug, know what the
results of “mixing” will be before drinking. This advice is
true whether the drug is by a doctor’s prescription, “off
the shelf” or “off the street.”
You must not drive while impaired. Your life, and the
lives of others, depend on you.

127
WHAT CAN YOU “GAIN” BY DRIVING WHILE
IMPAIRED?
• heavy fines
• a criminal record
• the loss of your licence
• loss of employment (if driving is required)
• reduced social life (no Driver’s Licence)
• higher automobile insurance costs
• time in jail
• damage to property
• serious injuries
• death

128
SHORT-TERM SUSPENSIONS
All drivers whose BAC exceeds .05 but not .08, is
subject to a period of suspension of twenty-four hours
for the first offence, thirty days for a second offence
within 24 months, and ninety days for a third and
subsequent offence within 24 months.
PENALTIES FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING
ADMINISTRATION DRIVING PROHIBITION (ADP)
A police officer has the authority to issue a 90-day
suspension of a Driver’s Licence (ADP) at the time of
an impaired driving charge. This administrative
suspension becomes effective seven days after the
date of the charge. The conviction for this offence later
results in a cancellation of your driving privileges for
one, three or five years.

Chapter 4: Impaired Driving
UNDER THE AGE OF 19 – “ZERO TOLERANCE”
In the case of a driver who is less than 19, or is in the
GDL Program and a valid Driver’s Licence for less than
two years, and a roadside screening device registers
a blood alcohol content (BAC) reading, a police
officer has the authority to impose a 24-hour driving
suspension in addition to the 90-day administrative
driving prohibition.
HABITUAL OFFENDERS
Habitual offenders are drivers with two or more
convictions of impaired driving. They must undergo an
alcohol/drug assessment and possible treatment
before reinstatement of their driving privileges.

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

MOTORCYCLES AND MOPEDS
Motorcycles and mopeds and their drivers are part of
the Highway Traffic Act of Prince Edward Island.
A motorcycle is a motor vehicle having a saddle/seat
for the rider and is designed to travel with not more
than three wheels. A moped or “motor-assisted bicycle”
is like a motorcycle but smaller in size and with less
power. A moped travels at speeds up to 50 km/h (30
mph). Motor scooters are included in the definition of
motorcycles and are governed by the same
regulations.
Laws concerning motorcycles and mopeds cover such
areas as licensing, registration, valid inspection and
driving procedures. You must be licensed in order to
drive a motorcycle or moped on a public street or
highway.
Motorcycle and moped operators must:
• wear adequate protective, approved headgear;

• know and comply with the rules of the road when
driving their vehicles;
• sit on the regular seat of the vehicle, not the
handlebars or foot pegs, etc; and
• carry only as many passengers as the vehicle has
been designed and built to carry.
CHOOSING THE RIGHT MOTORCYCLE
In choosing your bike, consider what type of driving
you plan to do. A small motorcycle may lack the power
required to maintain highway speeds and may be
unstable at higher speeds.
On the other hand a motorcycle that is too big may be
difficult to control. If your motorcycle is the right
size, you should be able to:
• have one foot flat on the ground as you straddle
your upright bike;
• push, park and put your bike on its stand without
straining;

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
• comfortably reach and operate all controls without
straining or stretching;
• lift the motorcycle by the handlebars when it
is lying on its side (lock front wheel when lifting if
possible); and
• know what type of driving you plan to do and make
sure you choose a motorcycle that is designed for
that purpose.
MOTORCYCLE EQUIPMENT
• Brakes —
capable of being operated on not fewer than two
wheels.
• Headlight —
at least one and not more than two headlights
must be on when the motorcycle is being
driven.
• Rear lamp and brake light —
one rear lamp and brake light. These may or may
not be the same light.

131

The licence plate must be well lit.
• Muffler —
a muffler in good working order. Inspect the
exhaust system for the presence of a sound
muffling device, broken mounts, removal of internal
baffles or packing and the addition of any cut-out
or bypass device.
• Handlebars —
must be securely fastened and not exceed 0.3
metres (12 inches) in height as measured vertically
from its point of attachment at the frame.
• Foot rests —
for use in the normal sitting position by an operator
and passenger where the motorcycle is equipped
for carrying a passenger.
• Left side rear-view mirror —
must give the driver a view of the highway at least
60 metres (200 feet) to the rear and will not be less
than 75 mm in size.

132

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

• Horn —
capable of being heard at 60 metres (200 feet).
• Seat —
carry only as many people on the motorcycle as it
has been designed and built to carry.
• Turn signal lights —
amber lights on the front and amber or red lights
on the rear are required.
• Goggles —
It is advisable that both drivers and passengers are
protected by glasses, goggles or a transparent 		
shield. This shield should be colourless for night 		
driving and should not alter your perception.
• Helmet —
required for all riders and passengers; must be
approved by the DOT, Canada Standards
Association, ANSI or SNELL.
• Annual motorcycle inspection is required.

BIKE CHECK
• Tires - be sure that your tires are properly inflated.
Use an air pressure gauge to check pressure in both
tires every day before you ride. High or low tire
pressure may cause improper handling. Always
check the tires for tread wear. Never ride on tires
that show cracks, cuts or bulges
which could cause a blow out.
Badly worn tires are dangerous,
especially in wet weather.
• Nuts, bolts and cotter pins - your
bike’s vibrations may loosen
nuts, bolts and pins. Check them
regularly.
• Horn - test it. It may save your
life.
• Cables - check for worn, frayed,
kinked or broken strands. If you
find them, replace them. Make

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
sure all cables are well lubricated. Make sure the
throttle cable returns to idle position when
released. Check the clutch cable for proper 		
adjustment.
• Brakes - apply the front and rear brakes one at a
time to make sure that each one is working 		
properly.
• Lights - your headlight should come on when the
motor is running. Check both its high and low
beam. Also check your turn signals and brake
lights before you ride.
• Chain, drive belt or
drive shaft - adjust 		
and lubricate the
motorcycle’s drive
chain on a regular
basis as outlined in
your owner’s manual.

133

Check your owner’s manual for proper adjustment
of the drive belt. If your motorcycle has a drive
shaft, check its oil level(s) regularly.
• Mirrors - keep your mirrors clean. Each mirror
should allow you to see about half of the lane
behind you and as much as possible of the lane
beside you. When properly adjusted a mirror may
show part of your arm or shoulder. Make these
adjustments before starting as it is difficult and
dangerous to make them while moving. Remember
that objects in your mirrors may be closer than they
look. Take a quick look over your shoulder before
every turn. Never rely entirely on your mirrors.
• Gas, water and oil levels - check the levels of your
gas, water and oil levels before starting. Check for
leaks. A seized motor could cause your rear wheel
to lock and cause a loss of control.

134

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

Your motorcycle is a unique vehicle. It requires both
skill and balance from you if it is to be driven safely.
Only practice can teach you everything that is needed
but here are a few tips that may help you:
1) Seat - sit far enough forward so that your arms are
slightly bent when you hold the handle grips. This
will allow you to turn the handlebars without
stretching.
2) Hands - hold the handle grips lightly but firmly and
use the “wrist down” method which will help you
from accidentally using too much throttle.
3) Balance - to help you keep your balance during
turns, hold your knees firmly against the gas tank
and look in the direction that you want to go. Do
not look down.
4) Feet - should be firmly on the footrests at all times
when the motorcycle is moving. Keep your toes up.
If they drop down they may get caught between
the road and the footrest. You need your feet for

effective braking and gear selection, so be sure to
keep them near those controls at all times.
5) Starting Off - starting and stopping are two areas
where you can easily lose control. It is best for
beginners to practice starts and stops in a safe,
traffic-free area until these skills have been
mastered. You need smooth coordination between
clutch and throttle. Too much throttle can cause you
to lose control, too little will cause the engine to
stall.
WHAT A MOTORCYCLE DRIVER SHOULD KNOW
• Know your motorcycle well enough so that you can
find and use switches and the controls without
taking your eyes off the road. This is particularly true
of the turn signals, horn, dimmer switch, choke,
motor cut-off switch and fuel control valve.
• Make sure your motorcycle is in good mechanical
repair before every ride. Before you ride, check your
motorcycle’s controls. Be sure you know the gear

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds

•

•
•
•

pattern. Work the throttle, clutch and brakes a few
times before you start. Ride with extra care until you
are used to the way your motorcycle handles.
Slow down on corners and give yourself extra
stopping distance.
Remember that you have no seat belt or metal box
around you for protection in a collision. Always
drive with extreme care.
Never ride after drinking alcohol or taking drugs
which may affect your reactions and judgment.
Do not drive when you are tired.
Avoid becoming dehydrated.

WEAR PROPER CLOTHING
Protect your skin and eyes from the sun, wind, bugs
and debris. Leather is best but heavy nylon or denim
jackets and long pants are acceptable. Do not let flaps,
laces or anything else dangle from your clothing.
Do not wear clothing that may flap or balloon in the
wind as this may tire you or prove distracting. Wear

135

gloves and other clothing which is designed for
motorcycle use.
ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET
Helmets approved for motorcycle use are required by
law in PEI and must be worn by the driver and
passenger. Helmets should fit correctly. It should be
snug enough so that it does not slip around your head
with the chin strap done up. Make sure your helmet
meets all safety standards before you buy it. Replace
helmets that have been dropped, scraped or damaged
in a collision. Use only soap and water to clean
your helmet.
ALWAYS WEAR BOOTS
Do not wear shoes that are loose fitting or that have
rings or laces that may catch on controls. Leather or
heavy nylon boots are best. They should be sturdy and
high enough to protect your ankles. Their soles
should be made of hard material and should have a

136

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

pronounced tread pattern. Wear footwear that allows
you to properly operate the foot controls.
PROTECT YOUR EYES
Wind and rain can tire your eyes and blur your vision.
Dust, bugs and debris can hurt your eyes and
cause you to lose control of your motorcycle.
Windshields help deflect wind, rain and flying objects
but do not protect your eyes. Wear protection even
behind a windshield.
Your eye protection should:
• be free of scratches;
• allow clear vision on both sides;
• allow room for eyeglasses, sunglasses or safety
glasses;
• be securely fastened; and
• be made of shatterproof material.

WEAR GLOVES
Gloves keep your hands warm and give you a better
grip on the controls. Gloves specifically designed for
use on motorcycles are best.
BE SEEN
For a motorcyclist, being seen may be the difference
between life and death. Wear bright colours such as
orange, red or yellow. Fluorescent colours are
especially good. Reflective tape on your motorcycle,
helmet and jacket is a good idea.
BEFORE STARTING OUT CHECK THE FOLLOWING:
• the front wheel is not locked;
• the rear-view mirror is adjusted;
• the gas is turned on;
• the engine is warmed up and running smoothly;
and
• the lights are on.

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
Take the motorcycle off the stand before you allow
passengers to get on. Always check your footing
before you take the bike off the stand.
MAKE SURE YOUR WAY IS CLEAR OF:
• children;
• pedestrians;
• other traffic; and
• any obstacle.
BEFORE YOU PULL AWAY MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE
Use your rear-view mirror but don’t rely on it
exclusively. Look over both shoulders to check the
spots you can’t see in the mirror.
Make sure traffic sees you. Many car drivers have
trouble seeing motorcycles and may pull out in front
of you. Most car drivers involved in a collision with a
motorcycle say they never saw it. Use your signals and
yield to other traffic when entering the traffic flow.

137

STARTING ON A HILL
It is more difficult to get a motorcycle moving on an
upgrade than it is on flat ground. There is a greater
danger of rolling backward into someone behind you
or stalling the motor. Here is the best way to start on
a hill.
1) Use the front brake to hold the motorcycle while
you start the engine and shift into first gear.
2) Change to the foot brake to hold the cycle while
you operate the throttle with your right hand.
3) Open the throttle a little bit for more power.
4) Slowly release the clutch and rear brake as you
apply more power with the throttle. If you release it
too quickly, the front wheel may come off the
ground or the engine may stall.
5) Release the foot brake when the engine begins to
slow down as the clutch takes hold.

138

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

SHIFTING GEARS
Smooth and timely gear-shifting takes practice but,
once you learn it, it will reduce wear on your
motorcycle and help you maintain control.
Your owner’s manual will tell you the maximum speed
for each gear. Remember, always be in the correct
gear for the speed at which you are traveling, whether
you’re speeding up or slowing down.

the gear-change pedal as far as it will go and
release it.
3) Release the clutch lever fully but gradually as you
apply more throttle to match the engine speed for
the desired speed of travel.
4) Make sure you shift down through all gears as you
slow down or stop. This way you always have
enough power to accelerate quickly if required.

There is more to shifting gears than simply getting the
motorcycle to accelerate smoothly. Loss of control
or collisions occurs if the gears are used incorrectly
when downshifting, turning or on hills.

Make certain you are going slowly enough when you
shift into a lower gear. If you are going too fast, the
motorcycle will lurch and the rear wheel may lock. This
is even more likely to happen while you are going
downhill or shifting into first gear. Under those
conditions you may need to use the brakes in order to
slow down enough to shift safely.

DOWNSHIFTING
Downshifting can be more difficult to do smoothly
than upshifting. Here is how to do it:
1) Close the throttle.
2) Squeeze the clutch lever and open the throttle
slightly, with a firm positive motion, and push down

SHIFTING IN A TURN
Do not shift gears in a turn except in an emergency. A

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
sudden change in power to the rear wheel can
cause it to lock or spin, creating a skid. It is best to shift
gears before entering a turn.
TURNS AND CORNERS
There are two ways to turn your motorcycle. When
driving a motorcycle less than 20 km/h, you can steer
by turning the front wheel in the direction you want
to go. This requires good balance and coordination
between the clutch and the throttle. Practise doing
this in a safe, traffic-free area.
At speeds greater than 20 km/h you must lean with
the motorcycle and master the skill called counter
steering or push steering. As you turn a corner at
higher speeds, your motorcycle is pushed outward by
centrifugal force. To counter this outward push, you
must lean inward. The greater the speed the more
you must lean. Many motorcyclists, especially

139

inexperienced ones, misjudge their speeds and
attempt to corner too fast. Slow down before you
reach the corner. Look through the corner in the
direction in which you are turning.
To produce your inward lean, push forward on your
handlebar on the side toward which you want to turn.
In other words push forward on the handlebar with
your right hand in order to turn right. Push forward
with your left hand in order to turn left.
As the bike begins to lean you will automatically turn
the handlebars in the direction of the lean. This
technique is helpful in everyday situations and in
avoiding debris, potholes and collisions.
Things to remember:
• use a light but a firm grip on the handlebars for all
turns;
• lean in the direction of the turn;
• gradually roll on the throttle through the turn;

140

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

• maintain a steady speed or accelerate gradually;
• avoid slowing down while in the turn; and
• accelerate slightly and use push steering to
straighten the bike as you come out of the turn.
BRAKING AND STOPPING
Most motorcycles have two brakes which are operated
independently. When stopping, use both front and
rear brakes, applying both at the same time. The
front brake provides about 75% of your motorcycle’s
braking power and should be used in most
circumstances; however, at low speeds use of the front
brake may cause a fall.
Some motorcycles have been equipped with
integrated braking systems that link front and rear
brake operation together. Antilock brake systems are
also available on some models. If your bike has either
one of these systems, check your owner’s manual for
instruction on the best way to use your brakes.

HERE ARE SOME BRAKING TIPS:
• downshifting as you brake will allow you to use the
engine compression as a brake, as well;
• use extra caution when braking in a turn or on
slippery or rough roads. For maximum braking in
a curve, straighten the bike to the upright position,
straighten or square the handlebars before firmly
applying both brakes;
• practise controlled stops in a safe, traffic-free area;
• learn to apply even braking and acquire a feeling
for when your wheels are about to lock up;
• you can brake in a turn by applying both brakes but
use caution. Take care not to lock either wheel,
especially on slippery road surfaces;
• remain in first gear while you are stopped so you
can move out quickly if necessary. Keep at least one
brake firmly applied while you are stopped in case
the clutch becomes engaged by mistake;
• never ride with your brake partially applied. It turns

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
on your brake light which confuses other drivers
and causes unnecessary wear on your brakes;
• it is important that you stay aware of what is behind
you by checking your mirrors often. Leave plenty of
space, at least three seconds between you and the
vehicle ahead. Not only will this help you avoid a
collision with the vehicle in front, but it will also
help you drive more smoothly and save you from
sudden stops which could get you rear-ended;
• for emergency braking use both brakes to
the maximum effort but do not lock the wheels.
Overbraking one, or both wheels is one of the most
common causes of skidding;
• apply the front brake fully. If it locks, release the
brake immediately. At the same time press down on
the rear brake. If it accidentally locks, keep it locked
until you have stopped completely. If your
motorcycle is upright and moving in a straight line,
you can still control it even if the rear wheel locks. If

141

the skid is caused by over-acceleration, ease up on
the throttle. Steer in the direction you want the
front of the bike to go; and
• avoid sudden braking on loose sand or gravel,
slippery roads, painted or metal surfaces, or on wet
roads, especially during the first few minutes of rain.
SKIDS
Most skids are the result of driver error such as:
• turning too sharply or at too great a speed;
• braking too hard, usually the rear wheel; or
• accelerating too fast.
These driver errors are made even worse by poor road
conditions such as slippery surfaces or loose sand
or gravel. Plan ahead so that you will not be forced to
make rapid movements. If you are not familiar with the
road, drive more slowly.
If you do get into a skid, don’t panic. If handled

142

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

properly, you may
be able to get out of
difficulty.
When a slight rear
wheel skid is caused
by over braking, it
can be corrected
by steering in the
direction of the skid and slowly letting up on the
brake.
The proper method of correcting a skid is explained in
the previous section under the heading Braking and
Stopping.

Your motorcycle may have a centre stand, a side stand
or both. These are usually operated from the driver’s
left side. You should
make a habit of
dismounting to
your left.
When leaving your
motorcycle parked
make sure the
transmission is in
first gear, the front
wheel is locked
and the ignition key is removed.
Try to avoid parking your motorcycle on a hill.

PARKING
Park where it is safe and legal. Signs, curb markings
and common sense will tell you if you can park.

Many motorists do not expect, or see motorcycles
sharing the same roadway with them. Although a
collision may be their fault that won’t help the cyclist

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
who, almost always, will wind up on the short end of
any crash.
WHERE TO DRIVE IN TRAFFIC
One of the ways for you to be seen is to know and use
the correct road position for every situation. While
there is no single position that is best, the following is
good positioning advice.
MAINTAIN A SPACE CUSHION
Avoid remaining beside other moving vehicles. They
may suddenly change lanes by moving into your
lane.
Keep your distance. The closer you follow another
vehicle, the greater the risk to you. The best
protection you can have is the distance between you
and others.
Distance provides three advantages:
• time to react so that you don’t hit anything or

143

anyone;
• some place to go should the unexpected happen;
and
• the ability to avoid panic stops which could cause
you to be rear-ended.
Stay at least three
seconds behind the
vehicle ahead. At higher
speeds, or when road
conditions are not
perfect, stay even further
behind.
Increase your following distance if the vehicle behind
you is following you too closely. This will allow you to
stop more gradually and may save you from being
rear-ended.
Remember that speed limits are posted as the

144

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

maximum speed limit. If conditions are not ideal, slow
down.
LANE POSITION
Experienced riders know that they must constantly
adjust and readjust their lane positions depending
upon changing traffic conditions. The left track of an
automobile is often recommended as the best place
to ride because:
• you can avoid the oil slick formed in the centre of
the lane by drippings from other vehicles;

many times when
it is smarter to
use the centre or
right portion of
the lane in order to
expand your space
cushion.

• you can see oncoming vehicles more easily;
• oncoming drivers can see you more easily;
• you use the full lane you are entitled to, discouraging
motorists from trying to share your lane; and
• you can see farther into, and be more easily seen
from, road junctions on the right.

When following
another vehicle,
stay out of the other
driver’s blind spot. Ride where you can be seen
clearly in the other vehicle’s rear-view mirror. Stay
well back so that you will be better seen. This will also
give you more time to react to unexpected actions of
others and to road hazards such as potholes and
debris. Be prepared to sound your horn if necessary to
let other drivers know you are there.

These are advantages most of the time, but there are

Always assume the other drivers around you do not

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
know you are there. Try to fore-see what other drivers
may do and plan ahead what you will do to avoid
them.
Drive in a lane position that clearly establishes your
space. Do not hug the centre line or the curb as it
may tempt other drivers to drive into the lane beside
you.
Do not try to share a lane with other drivers, not even
to get around a line of stopped traffic. You will not
be expected and you could be seriously hurt.
Be extremely careful when driving beside other traffic.
You may not be seen and the other driver might
make a sudden shift into your lane. Be sure you are
where the other driver has the best chance to see
you. Stay out of the other driver’s blind spot.
INTERSECTIONS
Most collisions involving motorcycles happen at

145

intersections. The two main causes of collisions at
intersections are from:
1) oncoming
vehicles making a
left turn in front of a
motorcycle; and
2) vehicles entering
from a side street.
To avoid collisions:
• give yourself lots
of room;
• always slow down before entering an intersection;
even if other traffic is required to yield to you;
• be prepared to stop;
• always check your rear-view mirror so you know
how closely vehicles are following you;
• be prepared to move to either side of your lane,
whichever side will give you the most room;

146

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

• do not assume you have been seen until you get
some recognition from the driver; and
• don’t try to pass by squeezing past cars in your lane.
If you stall in the intersection and cannot start your
motorcycle, walk the motorcycle clear of all traffic and
out of the intersection. Put on your four-way flashers if
the motorcycle has them.
CHANGING LANES
There is always some risk involved when changing
lanes and it’s up to you to do it safely. Avoid
unnecessary lane changes. The few seconds you might
save by constantly switching lanes is not worth
the risk. Plan ahead as you drive so that you are not
trapped into making sudden lane changes.
When changing from one lane to another:
• make sure a lane change is permitted;
• check traffic ahead and use your mirrors to check

traffic behind you;
• always look back quickly over your shoulder to the
lane into which you will be moving because mirrors
do not show all areas where there are blind spots;
• give proper signals; and
• look again and, if it is safe, make the lane change.
PASSING
Cooperate if someone is passing you. It is illegal and
dangerous to speed up when you are being passed.
Slow down if necessary to make sure the passing
vehicle has room to move in safely.
Be careful when a large vehicle is coming toward you
as it can block a strong crosswind or create a pull of
its own which may cause you to lose control.
Passing another vehicle looks easy but there is always
risk involved. Don’t pass unless it is necessary. If
it is necessary to pass, be sure you are passing in a
legal passing zone and make sure it is safe to pass.

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
Do not pass:
• near the crest of
a hill;
• within an
intersection;
• at a railway
crossing;
• on a curve or
any place where
your view ahead
is obstructed;
• on the shoulder of the road;
• when the traffic in front of you is slowing down for
an unknown reason; or
• a vehicle that has stopped for a pedestrian.
When passing:
• check your rear-view mirror;
• take a quick look over your shoulder into the lane
into which you will be moving;

•

signal;
look ahead for oncoming traffic;
check over your shoulder one more time; and
go ahead if it is safe.

After passing a vehicle:
• make sure it is visible in your rear-view mirror;
• check over your shoulder;
• signal;
• allow a sufficient space cushion; and
• move back into your travel lane when it is
safe to do so.
NOTE: It is illegal to go over the speed limit when passing
another vehicle.
DRIVING WITH PASSENGERS
You should not carry a passenger until you become
experienced in the operation of a motorcycle. The

148

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

extra weight changes the way a motorcycle handles,
the way it turns, speeds up and slows down. You are
legally responsible for your passenger’s safety.
TIPS FOR SAFE DRIVING
• The person behind you should sit as far forward as
possible without crowding you.
• Make sure your passenger understands that they
must sit still, especially when you are manoeuvring
your motorcycle.
• Have a proper seat and foot pegs that allow the
passenger to sit behind you without moving you
from your normal position.
• A passenger should have the same type of
protective equipment, eye protection and clothing
as the driver.
• Be sure your passenger knows what is expected of
them before you start out.

• Tell your passenger never to get on or off the
motorcycle without asking you first.
• Allow first-time passengers to get used to riding by
first taking them out at slow speeds in light traffic
situations.
NOTE: Both passenger and drivers are required by law to
wear approved helmets.
TO ADJUST FOR ADDED WEIGHT OF A
PASSENGER, YOU SHOULD:
• operate at a slower speed, particularly on corners,
curves or bumps;
• begin to slow down earlier than usual when you
approach a stop;
• allow a greater following distance; and
• look for the large gaps whenever you cross, enter
or merge with traffic.
NOTE: Before you make any new move, be sure to warn
your passenger so that there are no surprises.

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
GROUP RIDING
Group riding is acceptable but you and the group
have no special rights on the road.
TIPS FOR GROUP RIDING
• Select an experienced leader and put inexperienced
riders behind the leader.
• Be considerate by limiting the size of your group to
four or five motorcycles. If you have more drivers
than that, break into two or more smaller groups.
• Never ride side by side. If you do it in the same lane,
it is illegal; and, if you do it in separate lanes, it may
impede traffic and limit your ability to manoeuvre
in an emergency.
• Use the three-second following rule. Keep a safe
distance between motorcycles.
• Plan ahead. Make sure everyone knows the route.
• Let the last motorcycle set the pace. No one should
have to race to keep up. Use your mirrors to keep
an eye on the motorcycle behind you.

149

HAZARD AWARENESS
Anticipation is the best way to avoid a dangerous
situation. If you can recognize and prepare for a
dangerous situation before it becomes unavoidable,
you can plan your escape in time. Stay fully aware of
what is going on around you and adjust accordingly.
When you see a potential danger, slow down and
plan a course of action that allows for the unexpected.
Examples:
• if children are playing near the street, plan what you
will do if one runs out;
• if cars are approaching from either side at an
intersection and one is not yielding, be prepared to
react;
• know how to proceed when you hear a train whistle
sound as you approach a railway crossing; and
• understand what it means to you and your
motorcycle when the road ahead of you changes
from pavement to loose gravel.

150

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

These are only a few cases that could put you or
someone else in a dangerous situation. In your plan of
action, you must not only consider the danger you
have seen but any additional danger that may be
created while trying to avoid the first problem.
For example, you must know how close the car is
behind you before you brake suddenly. You must
know what is developing in all directions around you.
NIGHT DRIVING
You have a greater risk of being in a collision when
driving at night. Even with the best lights, you cannot
see or be seen as clearly at night.
To drive safely, you should:
• cut your speed at night to below daytime speed;
• allow more distance when following another
vehicle to give yourself more time to react. Keep a
following distance of three or four seconds;
• signal earlier and brake sooner;

• not pass unless it’s necessary;
• make sure you can stop in time for any sudden
obstruction within the range of your headlights.
Don’t overdrive your headlights;
• stay alert. Everything is harder to see at night. If you
are sleepy, stop;
• keep your goggles, face shield and windshield
clean. If they’re badly scratched, replace them. At
night use only clear untinted lenses;
• make sure you’re visible. Clean your headlights
and reflectors if they’re dirty. Wear bright colours.
Add reflective tape where it will do the most good.
A reflective vest is ideal; and
• be alert for animals that can run out of ditches
to cross the road. Scan the roadside far ahead and look
for movements or the reflection of an animal’s eyes.

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
RIDING IN POOR WEATHER
Take the same precautions you would as when you are
riding at night. When you are faced with poor
weather at night, use extra care when braking or
accelerating. Think twice before you drive in any poor
weather.
RIDING ON DANGEROUS SURFACES
Surfaces such as wet pavement, gravel roads, mud,
snow, ice, painted lane markings and steel surfaces
(utility hole covers) should be avoided if at all possible.
If you cannot avoid these surfaces:
• slow down;
• use your brakes smoothly and gently;
• avoid sudden moves. You should turn, brake,
accelerate and change gears as little and as
gradually as possible;
• release the clutch smoothly when shifting gears;
• remember, loose material on a paved road is as

•

•
•
•

151

dangerous as a slippery road;
slow down and ride with care. Gravel and sand
surfaces may be less dangerous if you slow to a
moderate speed;
maintain a relaxed but firm grip on the
handlebars;
keep your arms and wrists loose and keep your feet
on the pegs; and
if the front wheel weaves a little, let it. Avoid fast
stops if possible.

When crossing a rough surface, try to meet the
obstacles head-on if possible. Some road surfaces such
as bridge decks are made of metal gratings. Your bike
will vibrate and wander slightly as it crosses the
grating. Don’t fight it. It is usually not dangerous if you
slow down in advance and maintain a constant speed.
Caution: Oil from cars and trucks usually builds up in
the centre of the lane. To avoid this danger, drive in the

152

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

track made by the
left tires of other
vehicles and use
extreme care and
good judgment.
When crossing
railroad tracks that
are at an angle to
the highway, it is
advisable to slow down before the
tracks and to cross them by proceeding straight ahead.
AVOIDING
OBSTACLES
A quick stop may not be enough to keep you from
hitting something in your path. If a piece of debris or a
pothole appear suddenly visible, sometimes the only
way to avoid a collision is with a quick turn.

The trick to making a quick turn is to get the
motorcycle to lean quickly in the direction you
wish to turn. To get the motorcycle to lean quickly,
counter steer. This means steering one way to send
the motorcycle in the opposite direction. If you wish
to turn right, push on the right-hand grip. This will
cause the front wheel to move slightly left. The result
is a lean to the right. As the motorcycle begins to lean,
you now can turn the handlebars in the direction it is
leaning to keep from falling over.
RIDING OVER OBSTACLES
Sometimes you have no choice but to ride over an
object that is seen too late to steer around. In this type
of situation, the basic rules to follow are:
• maintain a relaxed but a firm grip on the
handlebars;
• keep a straight course;
• stand slightly on the foot pegs;
• shift your weight back;

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
• accelerate slightly as the front wheel reaches
the object;
• slow down and move forward as you go over
the object; and
• resume your normal seating position and speed.
SUDDEN STOPS
If you have to stop quickly:
• keep the motorcycle upright and in a straight line
with the handlebars straight;
• apply each brake as hard as you can without
locking either wheel. If the wheel locks up and skids,
it may slide to one side making the bike hard to
control; and
• if you are forced to brake when the front wheel is
turned, do it gradually. Give more emphasis on the
back brake.
You need practice to know how hard you can brake
without locking the wheels and skidding.

153

In an emergency situation, use both brakes to the
maximum . Even though this may lock up your wheels,
you might have no other choice.
Remember, if you take your feet off the pegs for
balance, only your front brake remains on.
OTHER PROBLEMS
BLOWOUTS
If you have a blowout, you will need to react quickly to
keep your balance. You cannot always hear a tire
blowout but you should be able to detect a flat tire
from the way the motorcycle reacts. A front wheel
blowout is more dangerous since it affects your
steering. If the front tire goes flat, the steering will feel
heavy. If the rear tire goes flat, the back of the bike will
tend to sway from side to side.

154

Chapter 5: Motorcycles and M o p e d s

STUCK THROTTLE
A stuck throttle requires quick thinking. If the throttle
is wide open, use the engine stop switch and clutch
together, followed by the brakes. If it is stuck at a
normal operating speed, look for a safe place to stop,
signal your intention, move to a safe place before
using your engine stop switch and clutch together,
and then apply your brakes.
WOBBLE
When travelling at fairly high speeds, the front wheel
can suddenly start to wobble or shake from side to
side. Here is what to do:
• don’t brake;
• grip the handlebars firmly but don’t try to stop the
wobble; and
• gradually close the throttle and pull off the travelled
portion of the road as soon as you can.
Trying to accelerate out of a wobble will only make the
problem worse.

Causes of wobbles are:
• unequal tire pressure;
• bent or misaligned wheels;
• loose spokes;
• improperly mounted windshields;
• poor load distribution; or
• riding too fast for the design of the bike.
FLYING OBJECTS
A motorcycle rider may be struck by such flying
objects as insects or stones caused by other vehicles.
Whatever happens, concentrate on controlling your
motorcycle and staying on the road. As soon as it is
safe, pull off the travelled portion of the road and fix
the problem. Never try to fix the problem while you
are in traffic. You will need both hands and all of your
concentration to handle either problem. It is best to do
only one thing at a time.

C h a p t e r 5 : Motorcycles and Mopeds
Summary of Riding Tips
• Learn to operate a motorcycle properly. Get
professional driver training.
• Get your experience under the best conditions and
in light traffic.
• A large number of motorcycle collisions happen to
drivers with just a few months of operating
experience.
A motorcyclist is subject to the same rules of the
road that apply to other motorists.
• Remember the headlight on your bike must be on
at all times when riding.
• Understand that overbraking one or both wheels is
one of the most common causes of skidding. If the
front wheel locks, release the front brake
immediately. If you lock the rear wheel, keep it
locked. If the skid is because of over-acceleration,

ease up on the throttle. Steer slightly in the
direction you want the front to go.
Watch for loose sand, gravel or spilled fluids on
paved streets. This could be dangerous, causing loss
of control. Slow down and grip the handlebars
securely.
Maintain your position in your lane. Do not cut in
and out of traffic. Maintain a proper following
distance by using the three-second rule.
Always take a quick look over your shoulder before
changing lanes.
Use your eyes and your mirrors. Know where other
drivers are and what they are doing.
Always signal your intentions well in advance.
Keep your knees against the gas tank while
in motion.
Do not overload your motorcycle. Check your
owner’s manual for guidelines.
Protect yourself from the weather. Dress properly

and use an approved helmet for the driver and the
passenger.
Buy a windshield, goggles or a face shield to
provide protection. They are worth the cost.
Don’t ride too long in a day. Take frequent rest stops.
Stretching exercises before you ride and during
rest stops will help keep you fresh.
Be visible and drive defensively. Drive as if other
drivers cannot see you.
Be alert for a sudden change in wind strength when
riding during a strong side wind.
Avoid riding, if possible, when the road conditions
are icy, wet or slippery.
Look and plan ahead. Don’t be caught by surprise.
Use a tire pressure gauge daily. Keep the tires at the
pressure recommended by the manufacturer of
your bike. Check the tire pressure when the tires
are cold.

Chapter 6:

Bicycles

157

158
Bicycle use continues to increase as more people use
a bicycle for transportation, recreation, physical fitness
and energy conservation. Cyclists must obey the rules
of the road the same way as vehicles and are also
entitled to an equal share of the road.
INFORMATION FOR MOTORISTS:
When you are sharing the road with cyclists please
remember:
• many children riding bicycles on the street are very
young and lack the necessary training and skills for
safe cycling;
• be alert for small children on oversized bicycles. This
will increase the likelihood of erratic moves;
• when passing a cyclist, go around them like you
would any other vehicle;
• when you are preparing to make a right turn, watch
for cyclists who may pull up alongside your vehicle.
Check your blind spots;

Chapter 6: Bicycles
• when making a right turn, do not pull up beside a
cyclist and then turn directly in front of them and
cut them off;
• when pulling away from the curb always check for
cyclists who may be trying to pass you;
• when parked at the curb, always check for cyclists
when you open your vehicle door. It is the driver’s
responsibility not to open the vehicle door into
oncoming traffic;
• do not drive too closely behind cyclists as they do
not have brake lights to warn you when they are
stopping;
• cyclists are entitled to make left turns in the same
manner as motorists. Since they are exposed on left
turns, they will need extra consideration especially
on multi-lane roads;
• cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from
the curb and may ride even further out when they
have to steer away from drainage grates, pot holes,
debris, loose gravel or sand, wet or slippery

Chapter 6: Bicycles
surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even
dogs. Be aware of the roadway conditions that may
affect a cyclist; and
• do not blow your horn when you are passing a
cyclist. It may frighten them and cause them to
steer into your path. If you feel that you must use
your horn, tap it quickly and lightly while you are
still some distance away from the cyclist.
RULES OF THE ROAD FOR CYCLISTS
DO:
• keep both your hands on the handlebars except
when making a hand signal;
• keep both your feet on the pedals;
• ride in a single file except when overtaking and
passing another cycle;
• make sure your bike is equipped with at least one
headlamp (but not more than two), one red tail
lamp and at least one red reflector mounted on the
rear of the cycle when cycling at night;

159
• make sure your bike has effective brakes. You
should be able to make the braked wheels skid on
dry, level, clean pavement;
• always ride on the right side of the roadway as
close as possible to the right curb or the edge of the
road;
• use a bicycle path adjacent to a street or highway if
there is one;
• ride on the regular seat of the bicycle; and
• carry parcels in bicycle carriers so they do not
interfere with your control of the bicycle.
DO NOT:
• ride on a sidewalk;
• ride on a highway where signs prohibit bicycles;
• ride the wrong way on a one-way street. There are
no traffic signs in place for wrong way drivers;
• carry more people at one time than the cycle was
designed for; or
• hold onto or attach the cycle to any other
moving vehicle.

Chapter 6: Bicycles

160
Cyclists have just as much right to use streets and
highways as drivers of motor vehicles do. They also
have responsibilities when riding their bicycles. Bicycle
riders, regardless of age, must know and observe
traffic regulations. In most cases these regulations are
the same as those required of motor vehicle
drivers.
SPECIAL RULES FOR CYCLISTS
Always use proper lights and reflectors when riding at
night and wear light-coloured or reflective clothing.
Your bike must have:
• a lamp on front that is visible from a distance of 150
metres (500 feet);
• a red reflector on the rear that is visible from 90
metres (300 feet) to the rear;
• a bell or other device capable of giving a signal
audible for a distance of at least 30 metres (100
feet). Just as there are safe driving practices for

•
•
•

•

motor vehicle drivers, these are safe cycling
practices for bicyclists;
always stop and check for traffic when you are
coming out of a lane or driveway;
be alert for cars coming from driveways, lanes or
parking spaces;
as you approach intersections, watch for cars
turning right; they may squeeze you against the
curb; and
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians.

E-BIKES
E-bikes are limited-speed
motorcycles under the Highway
Traffic Act. These bikes are
considered a moped under the
rules of the Highway Traffic Act. A
valid driver’s licence is required to
operate an E-bike in Prince Edward Island.

Chapter 6: Bicycle Helmets
WHAT IS A BIKE HELMET?
A helmet protects your head from injury when you fall.
It has a plastic shell on the outside and foam inside. It
has a strap to keep it on when you fly through the air.
It only covers your head, and the rest of your body is
still exposed, so you still have to be careful.
HOW DOES A HELMET WORK?
The foam crushes when you hit the road. That
cushions the blow, and usually saves your brain. The
shell makes it skid on the street so your neck does not
get jerked. The shell also keeps the foam in one piece.
It can split when you hit the car and not be there
when you hit the street.
If the strap is not tight, your helmet can slip to the
side or to the back. Then your bare head hits the road.
Ouch. Pavement is very, very hard.

161
WHY WEAR ONE?
Under the Bicycle Helmet Regulations, everyone
who operates a bicycle must wear an approved
safety helmet. Being careful and not crashing is the
best way to stay safe. That’s better than crashing in
a helmet! The helmet only covers your head, so you
need to learn the rules of the road, but even the best
riders crash. If you hurt your brain, it can change you.
You may not be able to read this page, or play video
games, or talk, or run, or even feed yourself.
HOW DO I PICK ONE?
A magazine called Consumer Reports can tell you
which helmets are best, but they don’t test them
every year.
First, make sure the helmet has a sticker inside with
the letters CPSC somewhere on it. That means it
works. Then find one that fits you. That will keep it on

162
your head while you fly through the air. Work on the
straps to get the fit just right. You don’t have to pay a
lot for a good helmet. But be sure you like it and will
wear it.
CAN I WEAR IT TO SKATE?
Yes if you have in-line skates. For skateboards, you
need another helmet. Skateboards crash a lot.
WHAT IF I CRASH?
You will have to buy a new helmet. It is good for only
one crash.
FITTING A BICYCLE HELMET
POSITION
Put the helmet on your head so it sits evenly between
the ears and rests low on your forehead. It should
be about only one to two finger widths above your
eyebrow.

Chapter 6: Bicycle Helmets

Chapter 6: Bicycle Helmets
PADS
Put foam pads inside the helmet so it feels
comfortable but really snug. Usually, the helmet
includes more than one size of foam pads that can be
affixed inside the helmet for a better fit.
STRAPS
Tighten the chin strap as snugly as possible. Adjust
the junction of front and back straps just under the
ears and secure back strap without putting pressure
on the front strap.
If all of this sounds confusing, follow the simple Five
Step Helmet Fit Test below.
A GOOD HELMET FIT is as important as wearing one...
but it takes time. Allow as much as a half hour to get
a proper helmet fit. If fitting your child, don’t try to
“rush” it when they are trying to go outside to ride. Do
it while they’re relaxed and you have plenty of time.
Then secure the adjustments so the helmet is ready
for the next ride.

163
FIVE STEP HELMET FIT TEST
STEP 1
With one hand, gently lift the front of the helmet up
and back.
Problem
Helmet moves back to uncover the forehead.
Solution
Tighten front strap to junction. Also, adjust padding
thickness and/or position, especially in back. Make
sure chin strap is snug. If this doesn’t work, the
helmet may be too big.
STEP 2
With one hand, gently lift the back of the helmet up
and forward.
Problem - Helmet moves forward to cover the eyes
Solution - Tighten back strap. Make sure chin strap
is snug. Also, adjust padding thickness and/or
position, especially in front.

164
STEP 3
Put a hand on each side of the helmet and rock from
side to side. Shake your head “no” as hard as possible.
Problem
Helmet slips from side to side.
Solution
Check padding on sides and make sure straps are
evenly adjusted.
STEP 4
Open your mouth (lower jaw) as wide as possible,
without moving your head. The top of your helmet
should pull down.
Problem
Helmet does not pull down when opening
your mouth.
Solution
Tighten chin strap. Make sure junction is under
each ear.

Chapter 6: Bicycle Helmets
STEP 5
Check to see if the front edge of the helmet covers
your forehead. The front edge of the helmet should
not be more than one to two finger widths from your
eyebrows.
Problem
Helmet does not cover the forehead.
Solution
Position helmet no more than one to two finger
widths above eyebrows. Tighten any loose straps.
Make adjustments so the helmet stays over the 		
forehead.
Have someone else test your helmet fit by doing the
Five-Step Test outlined above. Hold your head still
during the test. The helmet should pass each of the
five steps.

166

Chapter 7: Highway Safety Programs

Safety is the main aim of the Highway Safety
Division. We are responsible for driver licensing,
vehicle registration and inspection. Highway Safety
administers programs for drivers who have
difficulty maintaining safe driving practices. These
programs are Driver Rehabilitation Courses, Driver
Improvement Courses and the Novice Driver Course.
DRIVER REHABILITATION COURSE
Alcohol is a major factor in automobile collisions and
fatalities. The Highway Traffic Act requires people who
are convicted of a first impaired driving charge under
the Criminal Code of Canada to take a Driver
Rehabilitation Course.
Highway Safety runs a Driver Rehabilitation Course
(DRC) to educate people convicted of:
• impaired driving;
• refusing the alcohol roadside screening test; or

• failing the breathalyzer test, e.g., having more than
0.08 blood alcohol content.
Each person having a conviction must attend and
successfully complete a Driver Rehabilitation Course
before he or she can become eligible for the
reinstatement of their Driver’s Licence.
A Driver Rehabilitation Course involves resource
people, including addiction counsellors, police, legal,
insurance and other professionals.
The course includes:
• a series of films;
• discussions;
• lectures;
• demonstration projects; and
• written assignments about the problems involved
in drinking and driving.
The course is held in Charlottetown, Summerside and
Montague.

Chapter 7: Highway Safety Programs
DEFENSIVE DRIVING COURSE
This course is for drivers who wish to improve their
knowledge, skills and safe driving attitudes. They may
also wish to reduce the number of demerit points
accumulated on their driving record and avoid a
possible suspension. Drivers with up to 11 demerit
points may, upon successful completion of the course
and exam, be awarded three merit points. The course
includes six, one-hour sessions. Each session deals
with different methods of preventing collisions. It
offers drivers a way of improving their driving skills
and avoiding collisions.
The Canada Safety Council’s Defensive Driving Course
(D.D.C.) is made available in Prince Edward Island
through the St. John Ambulance (PEI Safety Council.)

167

DRIVER IMPROVEMENT COURSE
Drivers suspended under the Demerit Point System
must attend and complete the Driver Improvement
Course within a six-month period following the
reinstatement of a Driver’s Licence. Participation in the
course is not required of drivers whose licences are
suspended for other reasons.
The aims of the course are to improve drivers’ attitudes
and to encourage improved driving skills. Emphasis is
placed on a driver’s attitude toward obeying the law
and accepting responsibility.
The Driver Improvement Course consists of four, twohour classroom sessions which include lectures,
films and discussion. Drivers enrolled must pass a test
at the end of the course.
To find out more about these courses call the
Highway Safety office at (902) 368-5210.

Chapter 7: Highway Safety Programs

DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM SCHEDULE FOR
EXPERIENCED DRIVERS
The Demerit Point System gives a graduated number
of demerit points for traffic convictions based on the
seriousness of the traffic violation.
An experienced driver is a driver who has held a valid
Driver’s Licence for more than two years and is not
a newly licensed driver under the Graduated Driver
Licensing (GDL) Program.
The violations are as follows:
• accumulation of 6, 7 or 8 points – a warning letter;
• accumulation of 9, 10 or 11 points – an interview;
• accumulation of 12 or more points – a three-month
suspension.
The violator loses his or her Driver’s Licence when 12
demerit points are accumulated on his or her record
within a two-year period.

Chapter 7: Highway Safety Programs

THE DEMERIT POINT SYSTEM
The Demerit Point System provides for a graduated
number of demerit points for traffic convictions. The
system identifies drivers whose records show them to
consistently disregard the Rules of the Road,
thereby endangering their own and others’ safety.
When a driver accumulates a specified number
of demerit points, his/her Driver’s Licence will be
suspended for at least three months.

GRADUATED DRIVER LICENSING PROGRAM
NEWLY LICENSED DRIVERS
Newly licensed drivers undergo a probationary period
of two years, and passenger restrictions. During
Stage 2, a newly licensed driver is warned at three, four
or five demerit points, and suspended for one month
at the six-point level. During Stage 3, a warning will
occur at five, six, seven or eight demerit points and a
suspension for one month when nine demerit points

are accumulated. Corrective action is taken by safety
specialists during or shortly after the suspension.
While in the Graduated Driver Licensing Program,
if you receive a seat-belt fine, your licence will be
suspended. If any of your passengers are charged for
failing to wear a seat belt, you may be issued a fine.
GRADUATED LICENSING APPROACH
Recent changes to the Prince Edward Island Highway
Traffic Act regarding a Graduated Driver Licensing
Program for drivers went into effect April 1, 2007.
Following are the important changes:
Waiting Period
All drivers who receive their Instruction Permit must
wait 365 days (275 days if actively enrolled in a driver

Chapter 7: Ignition Interlock Program
WHAT IS THE IGNITION INTERLOCK PROGRAM?
The Prince Edward Island Ignition Interlock Program
will allow early reinstatement of a driver’s licence after
a drinking and driving conviction, upon a successful
application. The program is available to offenders and
is designed to encourage these individuals to get help
quickly and address any
alcohol-related problems.
HOW DOES AN
IGNITION INTERLOCK
DEVICE WORK?
Before starting the vehicle, the driver must blow
into the device. If the recorded blood alcohol
concentration (BAC) is above the pre-set limit, the
vehicle will not start. Once the vehicle is started, the
interlock device requires random breath samples at
pre-set times.

175

If a breath sample is not provided or if the BAC
exceeds the limit, the device will issue a warning,
record the event and activate specific alarm systems
(i.e. , alarm activated, horn honking, etc.) until the
ignition is turned off.
HOW CAN I APPLY FOR INSTALLATION OF THE
DEVICE?
You may complete and submit an application form.
HOW DOES THE PROGRAM WORK?
Eligible drivers will have interlock devices installed
in their vehicles. The driver will be issued a restricted
driver’s licence which allows the individual to operate
only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock
device. The device prevents the driver from starting
the vehicle if the device detects alcohol above the preset level in the driver’s breath samples. The driver

176

Chapter 7: Ignition Interlock Program

must return to the installation facility to have the
device calibrated and serviced at least every 60 days.
Failure to service the system by the required date
could result in the device locking itself. The vehicle will
not start and will have to be towed or arrangements
made to the interlock provider to allow additional
days to bring the vehicle in
for servicing of the device.
All program activity will be
recorded and monitored
by Highway Safety by way
of a built-in data logger.
Warnings will be issued to
participants who repeatedly
fail the breath test, and Highway Safety may order the
removal of the ignition interlock

device and reinstate the suspension period if
violations continue.
WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
PROGRAM?
The following criteria determines eligibility:
• You have been convicted of impaired driving or
refusing a breathalyzer demand.
• The Registrar of Motor Vehicles has authorized
your use of an ignition interlock device.
• You have served the court-ordered minimum
mandatory prohibition period.
• You have served all suspensions and paid all 		
outstanding fines.
• The vehicle in which the ignition interlock device
is to be installed has a valid registration,
		 insurance and vehicle inspection.

Chapter 8:

Collisions

177

178

Chapter 8: If You Are Involved in a Collision

Sometimes in spite of all your efforts to avoid a
collision, you may find yourself involved in one. All
drivers involved in a collision have certain duties and
responsibilities. The law provides stiff penalties for
failure to satisfy these requirements.
After any motor vehicle collision involving death,
injury or property damage where the damage to ALL
property apparently exceeds $1,000 you must report
the collision to the police immediately.
FIVE POINTS IN REPORTING COLLISIONS
1) The exact location.
2) The time of the collision.
3) The nature of damage to cars or other property.
4) The nature and extent of injuries to all people
involved in the collision.
5) The names and addresses of the drivers and owners
and their Drivers’ Licences and vehicle registration

numbers, and insurance details. It is also advisable
to obtain the names and addresses of any people
who witnessed the collision.
IF YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE
SCENE OF A COLLISION
If you are the first to arrive at a serious collision, your
first instinct may be to run to the car involved and
start pulling people out. Unfortunately, the efforts of
the rescuers often aggravate the injuries caused by
the collision.
Here is what you should do:
Park your car off the road, far enough away from the
collision scene to protect the vehicles from further
collisions with other cars. If a cell phone is available,
call 911 or send someone to call 911.

Chapter 8: If You Are Involved in a Collision
When you get to the cars involved, turn off the
ignitions to prevent fire.
If the occupants of the vehicle are hurt, leave them in
the car until trained help arrives. Do not twist or turn
them. They may have suffered a fracture of the spine
or neck, and moving them may do further damage.
If someone is pinned in the car, but otherwise free
from injury, crawl in the car and try to release the
injured person. If a driver is trapped by the steering
wheel, the pressure can be eased by releasing the seat
catch and pulling the seat back.
In case of fire, try to put it out with a fire extinguisher,
dirt or a blanket. Most fires start when the electrical
wiring is short-circuited. If you know how, try to
disconnect the battery, but be careful not to touch
metal parts with the “hot wire”, which could cause
a spark.

179

If you have been trained in first aid, you may give the
injured people some assistance. If not, follow these
tips:
• cover the injured people with blankets or coats to
keep them warm;
• loosen collars, ties and belts to help the injured
people to breathe;
• calm and reassure the injured people and tell them
help is on the way; and
• keep spectators away from the injured people.

180

Chapter 8: 911 Emergency/ First Aid

REPORTING AN EMERGENCY
USING YOUR CELL PHONE
First of all, as soon as you contact the
911 call-taker, give them your name and
cell phone number including the area
code so that if the connection is broken,
they can call you back. The call-taker will
ask you specific questions about the
emergency service you require and the
location and nature of the emergency. Remain calm
and answer the questions to the best of your ability.
The location is essential. If the
emergency is in an area that you are
not familiar with, try to describe the
area as accurately as possible.
Concentrate on nearby civic numbers, if there are any,
or the street name. You may have to walk or drive to
the nearest intersection to look at the road sign, or the
community name. You may have to ask someone in
the area for any or all of this information.

Leave your cell phone turned on. If you lose contact
with the call-taker as you move along a street or
through an area, try to re-establish contact with the
call-taker as soon as possible when you enter an area
of good transmission and reception. If need be, and
if at all possible, tell the call-taker that you will meet
the emergency vehicle at the nearest intersection and
guide them to the emergency.
FIRST AID
Please be aware of first aid procedures in case of a
collision. Drivers may encounter situations where first
aid will be a valuable asset. We have included a few
first aid tips.
For more information on first aid contact:

Chapter 9:

Mature Driver

181

182
THE OLDER BUT WISER DRIVER
After years spent behind the wheel, many senior
drivers have developed the skills, behaviours and
attitudes that keep them, and their fellow drivers, safe
on our roads. Studies show that older drivers are more
likely to obey the rules of the road, drive within posted
speed limits and really take to heart the prohibition
against drinking and driving.
Unfortunately, aging can take its toll on sight, hearing,
judgment of speed and distance, memory, attention
and reflexes. These changes can creep up so gradually
that older drivers don’t notice any impact on their
driving ability, until, one day, they are in a crash.
The good news is that we can compensate for the
effects of aging. All drivers, and especially older drivers,
can minimize their risks on the road by maintaining
physical well-being through proper diet and exercise,

Chapter 9: Mature Driver
planning their trips carefully, driving defensively and
choosing a vehicle that meets their needs.
Overall well-being contributes to driving performance,
so it is important that drivers talk with their doctors
about any problems that may interfere with their
driving. Regular check-ups and eye exams can reveal
specific conditions that affect driving. Some
medications can have an affect on driving
performance, so be sure to discuss this with your
physician. It is important for every driver, regardless
of age, to understand how medications and drug
interactions can affect them. Even over-the-counter
drugs can cause drowsiness, slow reaction time,
diminished concentration, blurred vision and impaired
mobility.
Ideally, drivers should assess their own driving
performance and try to identify situations that

Chapter 9: Mature Driver
challenge them on the road. Here are some questions
that can help you assess your status as a driver.
In the past few months, have you:
• experienced difficulty in negotiating sharp turns
and intersections;
• hesitated over right-of-way decisions or situations
you once took for granted;
• been surprised by the sudden presence of other
vehicles or pedestrians;
• received negative feedback (such as honking) from
other drivers;
• had difficulty seeing at night;
• become lost on familiar routes;
• felt nervous or exhausted after driving; or
• been cited for traffic violations or found at fault
in crashes?
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, it may
be time to take a driver refresher course or to consider

183
restricting when and where you drive. You may want
to limit your trips to daylight driving and avoid driving
in rush-hour traffic or in adverse weather conditions.
Choose routes that are well-marked, well-lit and that
have easy-to-reach parking places.
When selecting a vehicle, consider one with heightadjustable seats; tilt/telescoping steering wheel;
height-adjustable seat-belt anchors; legible
instruments; roof pillars that minimize blind spots;
big, glareproof mirrors; and push-button controls and
levers.
Drivers should enjoy the freedom of mobility that their
cars offer for as long as it is safe for them to do so.
A driver’s age is not an adequate predictor of
individual driving ability. Performance is what counts
on the road. With careful attention to our health and
our driving skills, we will all become older but wiser
drivers.
